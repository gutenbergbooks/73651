<h2 class="fs135 nobreak lsp2" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noindent">The great activity in shipbuilding and marine engineering during
recent years, and the substantial progress, both in science
and practice, which has marked the period, have often formed
the subject of articles in the technical and daily press, and of
papers read before professional institutions. So far as I am
aware, however, no single work dealing historically with modern
shipbuilding in a way at once trustworthy and popular, and in
a form handy and accessible, has yet been published. The
present work aims at supplying this want. In undertaking it
originally, I felt encouraged by the acceptance which various
articles, contributed to the columns of the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>, <cite>The
Engineer</cite>, <cite>The Steamship</cite>, <cite>Iron</cite>, &amp;c., had met with from many
whose good opinion I had reason to value highly. With the
kind permission of the proprietors of the above journals, I have
made use to some extent of the articles in question—but largely
amplified and corrected—in preparing the following pages.</p>

<p>The work is concerned exclusively with shipbuilding for the
merchant marine, and no attempt is made to trace the progress
connected with naval shipbuilding, although some of the many
important influences which the one exerts upon the other have
been indicated. Even as thus defined and restricted, the field
of review is so vast that the limits which I had determined
should bound the work with respect to price, and consequently
with respect to size, have compelled me to treat briefly and
in a general way many matters which it might have been of
interest to enlarge upon. The list of authoritative papers and
lectures to which readers can at first hand refer—given at the
end of each chapter—may, it is hoped, compensate to some
extent for these deficiencies.</p>

<p>The book being mainly historical, originality in the strict
sense of the term cannot, of course, be urged for much of the
contained matter; but efforts have been made throughout to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
present trustworthy statements of the very latest steps in
advance. This is specially true of the chapter on scientific
progress. My object, however, having been more to enlighten
general readers than to seek to interest or inform professional
ones, it is perhaps wanting in the scientific fulness needed to
give it special value, viewed from the standpoint of the trained
naval architect.</p>

<p>While the biographies and portraits given throughout the
book may be considered fairly representative of those who as
shipbuilders, shipowners, naval architects, or marine engineers
have made their influence felt on the world’s mercantile marine
during the period of review, the collection by no means includes
all who are deserving of such notice. The subjects of portraiture
are all in life, and actively engaged in their respective
spheres of labour. The diffidence generally evinced by them
in consenting that their likenesses and the note of their professional
career should be given, has made my task one of difficulty.
What may be called the over-diffidence of a few, originally
selected for portraiture, has to some extent occasioned the incompleteness
now commented upon.</p>

<p>As further accounting for the limitations of the present
work, I think it fitting to add that the preparation of the
whole book, including the task of seeing it through the press,
has devolved upon me at a time when the ordinary intervals
of respite from daily business have had to suffice for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to those firms and individuals to
whom I had to appeal for statistics and other particulars, for
their generally ready and courteous attention to my requests.</p>

<p class="p6">“Into a ship of the line man has put as much of his human patience,
common sense, forethought, experimental philosophy, self-control habits
of order and obedience, thoroughly wrought handwork, defiance of brute
elements, careless courage, careful patriotism, and calm expectation of
the judgment of God, as can well be put into a space 300 feet long; by 80
feet broad.”—<cite>Ruskin.</cite></p>


<p class="p1 p4b">“If any body of men have just cause to feel pride in their calling,
and in the fruits of their labour, shipbuilders have. If we look at the
magnitude of the operations of building, launching, engining, and completing
a modern passenger ship of the first rank, and regard the
multiplicity of the arrangements and beauty of finish now expected, and
then think this structure has to brave the elements, make regular
passages, convey thousands of human souls, and tens of thousands of tons
of merchandise every year across the ocean, in storm or calm, we cannot
but feel that they are occupied in useful human labour. But more than
this, there is a public sentiment surrounding ships that no other
mechanical structures can command. Beautiful churches, grand buildings,
huge structures of all kinds have a certain interest pertaining to
them, but it is different in kind from that which surrounds a ship. The
former are fixed, immovable, inert; the ship is here to-day and gone
to-morrow, building up a history from day to day with a reputation as
sensitive as a woman’s to calumny, and like her consequently often a bone
of contention as well as an object of admiration.”—<cite>William John.</cite></p>

<span class="fs80">RECENT PROGRESS IN STEAMSHIP CONSTRUCTION.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The achievements in shipbuilding and marine engineering
within recent years may be said to borrow lustre from
one particular feat of past times. The <i>Great Eastern</i> undoubtedly
furnished, in large measure, the experience that has
recently been causing so great a change in the tonnage of our
mercantile marine. Commercially, as is well known, that huge
vessel—“Brunel’s grand audacity,” she has been called—has
all along proved a lamentable failure. It has been stated on
good authority that between 1853—the year in which the
contract for her was entered into—and the year 1869, no less
than one million sterling had been lost upon her by the various
proprietors attempting to work her. Financially, indeed, she
may be said to have proved the “Devastation” of the mercantile
marine. Although at various times in her long life-time
she has unquestionably done most useful service in sub-marine
cable-laying—service, indeed, which, but for her, could not well
have been accomplished—these times of usefulness have been
far outbalanced by her long periods of inactivity.</p>

<p>Apart from commercial considerations, however, this premier
leviathan still stands out as a wonder and pattern of naval
construction. In her admirably-conceived and splendidly-wrought
<ins class="corr" id="tn-1" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'stuctural arrangements'">
structural arrangements</ins>—due to the joint labours of
the late Mr I. K. Brunel and Mr J. Scott Russell—she possesses
as successful an embodiment of the dual quality of
“strength-with-lightness” as can be found in any subsequent
ocean-going merchant ship. She was, if not the first, certainly
the greatest embodiment of the longitudinal system of construction,
and in virtue of this, as well as of her phenomenal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
proportions, she represents, alone, more of the intrepidity and
skill essential to thorough progress, than are exhibited by
combined hosts of the “departures” of recent times.</p>

<p>Despite the far-reaching views of the eminent designer, those
changes which have since taken place in the essential conditions
for successful ocean navigation eluded his vision. Owing to
the opening of coal mines in almost all parts of the world, it
is now no longer necessary nor desirable that a steamer should
be capable of carrying coals for a return voyage, either from
India or Australia—this being the dominant and regulating
condition in the <i>Great Eastern’s</i> design. Further, the improvements
in marine engineering, represented by the greater possible
economies in coal consumption and the fuller utilization
of steam, which have since been effected, have rendered the
great ship inefficient and obsolete. In short, Brunel and his
financial supporters were ahead of their time, and failed to
appreciate the law of progress, now better understood—“invention
must wait on experience.”</p>

<p>The urgent demands of our broader civilisation, improvements
in navigation, the spread of population in new colonies
and over wider continents, and, above all, the fresh accessions
of experience and invention, are forces which now impel shipowners
to increase the dimensions of their vessels, and shipbuilders
to carry out the work. Each year the contrasts as to
dimensions between the first leviathan and her later sister
grow less and less. The completion within the past few years
of such monster merchant ships as the <i>Servia</i>, the <i>City of
Rome</i>, the <i>Alaska</i>, and the <i>Oregon</i>, and the forward state of the
<i>Etruria</i> and <i>Umbria</i>, two remarkable steamships, building on
the Clyde for the Cunard Company, constitute an epoch in the
history of our mercantile marine, and give colourable justification
to the belief sometimes expressed, that the proportions of
the <i>Great Eastern</i> will in time be surpassed.</p>

<p>The feasibility—in a scientific sense—of ships growing in
proportions commensurate with the growth of commerce and
traffic, has often been commented upon. The whole tendency
of our time is towards the aggregation of effort: the massing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
capital and labour. A vessel of five thousand tons can be
built cheaper than five vessels of one thousand tons. In the
manning and working of ships there is a still more striking
economy, <em>e.g.</em>, one captain instead of five, and so on throughout
the staff of officers, engineers, stewards, and crew. Not only
so, but long ships can be propelled at greater speeds than
short ones, the whole conditions of construction, engines, and
propellers being considered. Mr Robert Duncan, in his
presidential address before the Society of Engineers and
Shipbuilders in Glasgow in 1872, declared:—“Looking forward
one generation, and measuring the future by the past, I think
it is not problematical that we shall see steamers of eight
hundred feet long the ferryboats of two oceans, with America
for their central station, and Europe and Asia for their working
termini.” Even since that was uttered, eleven years ago, we
have approached, in solid practice, the limit thus laid down, by
150 feet at least. Three years previous to Mr Duncan’s
address, vessels exceeding four hundred feet were not afloat,
with the notable exception already referred to; now, there are
few merchant fleets of any pretensions engaged in ocean traffic
which do not include vessels over or approaching four hundred
feet, and it is even no great boast that vessels close on six
hundred feet are afloat and in active service.</p>

<p>As better illustrating the growth in dimensions of merchant
steamships, the Figs. on the following page may prove interesting.
They show, all to the same scale, a number of representative
steam vessels from the <i>Comet</i> downwards.</p>

<p>Along with the change or evolution in the sizes and types
of merchant vessels, important modifications in their structural
arrangement have of late years been effected, and it is
to the constant progress being made in these matters—to the
skill and intrepidity which are brought to bear on their
execution, and to the readiness with which our shipowners
recognise their importance and value—that the maintenance
of our mercantile supremacy is largely owing. An American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
journal, writing a few years ago on this subject—perhaps with
more of taunt for the conceit and self-sufficiency evinced by
its own country than of adulation for the ability and enterprise
displayed by ours—said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the whole world there is no place whatever that can in any degree
compare with the Clyde for either extent or quality of steamship building; and
at this moment an indisputable verification can be adduced, for between
American and European ports there are at the present time something like a
score of steam navigation companies, doing an immense passenger and carrying
trade, with vessels of great power and magnificence, and notwithstanding the
variety of trade nationalities, at least two-thirds of the vessels employed were
built and equipped on the Clyde; and more—unless there has very recently
been a change, there is not an American steam company in the whole Atlantic
trade. With a run of about fifty years to try it, and after many unsuccessful
attempts, the Americans have utterly failed to sustain permanent competition.
All the British companies have prospered beyond any probable anticipation
clothed with reason. The Cunard Company, starting with four vessels some
forty years ago, have now twenty times that number. What is this something
which enables Europeans to so far outstrip the Americans in a competitive
traffic so as to exclude them from the merest show in the largest steam trade
in the world? A baneful, overweening, and ignorantly selfish conceit invariably
leads to disastrous results, and a nation given over to the fulmination of
concentrated boast cannot fail to be suffocated with foolery of its own
making.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is doubtless the outcome of a vicious antipathy—natural
in the circumstances—to those stringent and over-reaching
laws which forbid that ships built away from America
shall sail under the American flag, or enjoy the pertaining
privileges. American shipbuilders thus secured from the
encroaches of foreign competition, have enjoyed their own
pace, but at too great a sacrifice. Preferring to take the
material most at hand, the manipulation of which they well
understood, they have allowed their wood age to be dove-tailed
thirty years into our iron one, with the other result that
America now occupies as unimportant a place in the traffic of
the sea, as the above quotation indicates.</p>

<p>Evidences are not wanting, however, to show that America is
at least endeavouring, in some respects, to be abreast of the
times, and that she has brought herself to acknowledge and
follow the lead of this country. In this connection, the four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
new vessels presently being constructed for the U.S. Navy may
be shortly referred to. The vessels comprise three cruisers and
one despatch boat, all of which are being built by Mr John
Roach, of Chester, Pa., the material employed in their construction
being mild steel of American manufacture. Twin
screws will be employed for the propulsion of the largest
vessel—the <i>Chicago</i>—which is to be 315 feet long between
perpendiculars, 48 feet beam, and 34 feet 9 inches moulded
depth to spar deck. The other vessels are the <i>Boston</i> and the
<i>Atalanta</i>, single screw cruisers of 270 feet length; and the
<i>Dolphin</i>, single screw despatch boat, of 250 feet length and
high speed.</p>

<p>In almost every feature except machinery these new
American naval vessels strongly resemble Government vessels
of recent British build, a circumstance for which there is little
difficulty in accounting, as it is well known the naval authorities
in the States have within recent times been recruited by
young American naval architects educated in our Naval
College at Greenwich, and consequently steeped in British
naval practice. This and other facts, such as the visit of a
technical commissioner of the States’ navy, two years ago, to
our naval and mercantile shipyards—upon which he has since
fully reported—leave one in no doubt as to the source of
coincidence in design and structure.</p>

<p>The subject of America’s position as a shipbuilding and
shipowning country has involved reference to wood shipbuilding,
but to revert at any length to this topic in a work
dealing with modern progress in British shipbuilding, the bulk
of which is written of and for industrial and commercial
centres where wood shipbuilding has been long entirely
tabooed, is quite unnecessary. Doubtless, however, the
amount of wood and composite building still carried on in the
minor seaports of the United Kingdom, and in several of the
British possessions, is of sufficient importance to demand some
reference. As the present position of affairs in this connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>

<p class="noindent">Whence it appears that while 709,840 tons of the 1,779,112 tons of ships
removed from the register during the last five years were wooden vessels, only
94,283 tons of the 3,667,144 tons built and registered in the United Kingdom
during the same period were constructed of that material. In other words,
wooden ships represent 45 per cent. of the total losses, while they only represent
2·5 per cent. of the total tonnage built and added to the register during the

<p>Just as the introduction or general adoption of the compound
engine marked an epoch in the history of shipbuilding
and marine propulsion, so now the introduction of “mild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
steel” or “ingot iron” as a material for shipbuilding, together
with the more extended adoption of water ballast, and the
rapid development of the continuous-cellular system of construction,
may be said to constitute a fresh starting point in
the history of the industry.</p>

<p>Although the introduction of steel as a material for shipbuilding
dates at least as far back as 1860, its use has been
but partial or occasional until within very recent times. The
uncertainty as to quality, the frequent great disparity between
pieces cut from the same plate, and the special care needed in
the manipulation, prevented its general adoption. With the
highly-improved “mild steel,” however, first manufactured in
France, and applied to shipbuilding purposes there about nine
years ago, and subsequently introduced into this country,
began the more extended adoption of steel, which every day,
or with every accession to experience, is displacing iron.</p>

<p>The facts relating to the introduction into this country of
mild steel for shipbuilding purposes, may be briefly recounted.
In the latter end of 1874, Admiral Sir W. Houston Stewart,
Controller of the British Navy, and Mr N. Barnaby, Director
of Naval Construction, availed themselves of the opportunity
to observe and study the use of steel in the French dockyards
of Lorient and Brest, where three first-class armour-plated
vessels were then being built of steel throughout, supplied
from the works at Creusot and Terrenoire. Mr Barnaby, at
the meetings of the Institution of Naval Architects in March
following, gave an account of his observations during this visit,
and pointed out clearly and precisely to the steel-makers of
Great Britain all the indispensable conditions which would
have to be met and satisfied by steel for shipbuilding, so that
it could be used with confidence in the construction of the
largest vessels. Before the end of 1875, the Landore-Siemens
Company was enabled to fulfil these conditions, and the
Admiralty contracted with them to supply the plates and
angles necessary for the construction of two cruisers of high
speed—the <i>Iris</i> and the <i>Mercury</i>. The material involved in
this contract was steel obtained by the Siemens-Martin process.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Shortly after this the Bolton Steel Company was in its turn
able to produce by the Bessemer process plates and angles,
satisfying all the requisite conditions. The Steel Company of
Scotland, Butterly Company, and other important works, also
entered into the same business, and operations are still going
on in various parts of the country connected with the formation
of new works, and the perfecting of other processes.</p>

<p>The steel furnished by these different works, subjected as it
has been to systematic and severe tests continually applied, is
now possessed of the qualities of ductility, malleability, and
homogeneity, which render its employment in shipbuilding
<ins class="corr" id="tn-9" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'not only permissable'">
not only permissible</ins> but highly desirable. Its good and
reliable qualities have been admitted by the Constructors of
the Navy, the Officers of the Board of Trade, of Lloyd’s, and
of the Liverpool Registries, as well as by all the most competent
authorities. The experience of all who have practical
dealings with the material in the shipyard is that it entirely
satisfies—even more than iron—all the requirements of easy
manipulation. The confidence with which it can be relied on,
as to its certain and uniform qualities, places it on a much
higher level than the steel formerly manufactured; and its
superiority over the best wrought-iron as regards strength and
<ins class="corr" id="tn-9a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'ducility renders it'">
ductility renders it</ins> a highly preferable material.</p>

<p>While doubt exists, however, as to the adoption of steel for
shipbuilding being commercially advantageous; there must be
hesitancy on the part of shipowners and others concerned.
Although, since its introduction, mild steel has been greatly
reduced in price, the first cost of a steel ship is still somewhat
over that of an iron one, even after the reduction in weight
of material is made, which the superiority of steel permits of.
It has been shown that, about two years ago, a spar-decked
steamer, of 4,000 tons gross, built in steel, as against a similar
vessel built in iron, entailed an excess in cost of £3,570. The
advantages, however, which accrue from the change, both
immediate and in the long run, make the gain clear and considerable.
Steel ships have been built with scantlings reduced
one-fourth or one-third, and in some early cases even <em>one-half</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
from what would have been considered requisite had iron been
employed. Some authorities, not unnaturally, questioned the
wisdom of accrediting steel with all the qualities which make
such sweeping reductions justifiable. Except in vessels for
river or passenger service, however, this is much in advance of
the reductions obtained in ordinary modern practice.</p>

<p>The reductions allowed in vessels built to Lloyd’s requirements—and
it cannot be urged that this society is too reckless in
concessions of this nature—are 20 per cent. in scantling, and
18 per cent. in weight. As it is impossible to adjust the
scantlings of material to take the full advantage of these
reductions, and further, as allowance has to be made for extra
weight due to the continued use of iron in vessels of steel—for
purposes not essential to structural character—the
average weight-saving effected in practice is about 13 to 14
per cent. This represents, in the finished vessel, a clear
increase of at least 13 per cent. in dead-weight carrying power.
The gain obtained in general practice has been otherwise stated
on good authority as 7 to 7½ per cent. of the gross tonnage.</p>

<p>In trades where there is constancy of dead-weight cargoes,
this increase in dead-weight carrying power should speedily
recoup the owners for extra first cost, and in the life-time of
vessels generally, a clear pecuniary gain should result. In
trades, however, where the cargo consists of measurement
goods, the advantages are not so decided, for it may sometimes
happen that before vessels have been loaded to their maximum
draught the limits of stowage will have been reached. Even
here, however, the steel vessel has the advantage of her iron
rival; her hull is 13 per cent. lighter, and consequently may
be propelled at a given speed with much less expenditure of
power, and has the further advantage—often a very important
one—of a shallower draught. This latter consideration alone,
in a service where every iota of such saving counts, has
influenced many shipowners to adopt the steel.</p>

<p>As the manufacture of mild steel progresses and extends,
the assimilation of the rival materials as to cost is sure to
follow. Already very great advances have been made towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
this end, the fact being abundantly evidenced by the greatly
increased number of steel ships on hand, and by the establishment
of new works, and transformation of old, for the better
production of the new material. In 1877 mild steel was about
twice as costly as the iron in common use. The sources of
supply, however, were then comparatively few, and the thorough
and severe testing to which the new material had to be subjected,
necessarily increased the cost relatively to iron, which
has never been subjected to the same rigorous ordeal. In
1880, owing to the increased sources of supply and the progress
in manufacture, the cost of steel had been reduced, relatively
to iron, by about 50 per cent. At the time of writing (March,
<ins class="err" id="err-11" title="Erratum: was '1883'">1884</ins>), the price of steel for a good-sized vessel is—overhead—about
seven pounds, seven shillings and sixpence per ton;
while the corresponding figure for iron is about five pounds,
five shillings, or a difference of only about twenty-nine per
cent. in favour of the older material.</p>

<p>Doubts were at first expressed by not a few, regarding the
durability of steel ships compared with those of iron, such
misgivings being aggravated by the thinness of the steel
plating. This fear is being gradually lessened by the results
of laboratory experiments and <i lang="la">bona fide</i> experience—the broad
deduction from which is, that the deterioration of steel, under
the action of sea water, is no greater than that of iron, and
that, if the same care and constancy in cleaning and painting,
common to ships of the latter material, be extended to ships
of the former, their durability will be equal.</p>

<p>Several large shipowning companies were not slow to place
faith in the new material. In the early part of 1879, the
“Allan Line” Company entrusted to Messrs Denny &amp; Brothers,
of Dumbarton, the order for a huge vessel, which the intrepid
confidence of the principal partners in both the owning and
the building firms determined should be of mild steel, be
bound with steel rivets, and have her boilers of the same
material. This was the large steamer <i>Buenos Ayrean</i>, the first
transatlantic steamer built with the new material. She was
finished early in 1880, and had not been over nine months in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the water when the order for a second and still larger steel
vessel—the <i>Parisian</i>—had been given by the same owners to
Clyde builders. The Union Steamship Company of New
Zealand, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Messrs Donald
Currie &amp; Co., and several smaller companies, ordered vessels
of steel almost simultaneously, while yet the new material was
in the early stage of trial. Amongst the orders for steel
vessels which were subsequently given, the <i>Servia</i> and <i>Catalonia</i>,
for the Cunard Company; the <i>Clyde</i> and <i>Thames</i> and
<i>Shannon</i> for the Peninsular and Oriental Company; the <i>India</i>,
for the British India Company; the <i>Arabic</i> and <i>Coptic</i>, for the
Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, and the four twin screw
steamers of the “Hill” Line, represent the principals. The
companies who then adopted the new material have mostly
continued to have their new ships built of steel, and to name
the vessels since built and now building in which this material
is employed, would simply be to enumerate three-fourths the
fleet of high-class modern merchant ships. There were 21,000
tons of steel shipping built throughout the United Kingdom
in 1879; 36,000 in 1880; 55,000 in 1881; 126,000 in 1882;
and over 244,000 in 1883. It is computed that at the present
time the amount of steel shipbuilding going on throughout
the kingdom is not less than 175,000 tons, or the largest
amount on hand at any one time since its introduction.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The modification in the structural arrangement of ocean
trading vessels, already spoken of as the continuous-cellular
system, although only within very recent times receiving
extended adoption in the mercantile marine, possesses in some
of its essential features the prestige of years. So long ago as
1854, Mr Scott Russell strongly advocated the principle of
longitudinal construction, and applied it in practice to ships
of the mercantile marine, to the success of which, in a scientific
sense, the <i>Great Eastern</i> is surely overwhelming testimony.
The principle met with much scientific favour from many
besides Mr Russell, but it did not take root in solid practice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Pecuniary and other kinds of considerations interposed to
prevent its general adoption. The urgency for increase in the
size of vessels was not such as to make longitudinal strength
(the special advantage claimed for the new principle) a great
desideratum; and there was perhaps reluctance on the part of
shipbuilders to relinquish time-tried and familiar methods.
The system presently under notice—although, as has already
been said, the same, in its main principles, as the system then
advocated—by its descent through the Admiralty Dockyards,
by its application to merchant vessels—first of East Coast, and
then of Clyde build—and by its close association with water
ballast, has undergone many modifications which almost constitute
it a creation of recent times.</p>

<p>Sir Edward J. Reed, when Chief Constructor of the Navy,
introduced the bracket frame system of construction into iron-clad
ships of war, and, as already indicated, it is largely owing
to the experience of the system as applied and practised in
such cases—conjointly, of course, with its successful introduction
in the case of the <i>Great Eastern</i>—that in so short a time
it has reached the present structural perfection, and received
such wide extension in merchant steamships. That it has
recently received such wide adoption in the mercantile marine
is due not so much to its structural advantages—and these
are great—as to the way in which it lends itself to the
economical working of steamships in actual service. This
will be more explicitly referred to after some description of
the system as applied in merchant ships has been given.</p>

<p>It is somewhat away from the field this work is concerned
with, to trace the system in its stages of development in ships
of war, but it may be said, shortly, that the impulse which the
system has received in the mercantile marine has in no sense
been a transference of the activity which at all times since its
introduction has characterised the application of the system to
the vessels built in our naval yards.</p>

<p>In order to assist the non-technical reader in appreciating
what follows regarding the system in merchant ships, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
general idea of the cellular bottom principle of construction is
afforded by Fig. 1.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig1" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <span class="fs80">FIG. 1.</span>
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig1.jpg" alt="Cross section of hull">
</figure>

<p>This shows in section the bottom part of a vessel amidships,
fitted with a double or inner skin, extending across the ship
from bilge to bilge, and there connected in a watertight manner
to the outer bottom plating. A series of longitudinal plates
are worked, fore and aft; set vertically between the outer skin
of the vessel and the plating of the inner bottom, and connected
thereto by continuous angles. Between these “longitudinals,”
and at every alternate transverse frame, deep plate
floors, lightened with oval holes, are fitted, connected to outer
skin by the angle frame, and to inner bottom plating by pieces
of angles corresponding to the vessel’s “reverse frames.” These
floor plates are, in addition, connected by vertical angles to
the longitudinals. Intermediate between the deep plate floors
simple angle bar transverse frames and reverse frames are
fitted, to give support to the outer skin and to the inner
bottom respectively. Until recently, the deep floors consisted
of “gusset” or “bracket” plates, each division being fitted in
four separate pieces, the whole taking the form as shown in
dotted outline. This practice is still most largely followed,
but in those yards which are equipped with large hydraulic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
punching machines for piercing holes such as are shown in
Fig. 1, the solid floors have superseded the bracket or four-piece
floors, the change effecting a simplification of work and
decided structural advantages.</p>

<p>With the employment of water as a substitute for dry or
rubble ballast, the structural movement under notice may be
said primarily to have begun. This movement has resulted in
the present approved system, which, at the same time that it
has regard to water-ballast with all its attendant advantages,
most happily combines the important qualities of increased
strength and security. The need for ballast in vessels whose
service generally comprises “light” as well as “loaded” runs
(as in the coal trade between Newcastle and London), or in
trades where the full complement can only be obtained by
shifting from port to port, is obviously great. It is doubtless
to needs such as these, more than to any demand for increased
structural strength, that the introduction and extended application
of the longitudinal and bracket-plate principle is owing.</p>

<p>The screw-steamer <i>Sentinel</i>, built in 1860 by Messrs Palmer
of Jarrow, Newcastle-on-Tyne, is mentioned by some authorities
as embodying some of the main features of the longitudinal
and cellular bottom system, and the screw-steamers <i>Scio</i> and
<i>Assyria</i>, of 1440 tons, built in 1874 by Messrs Westerman,
near Genoa, have been noticed in a similar connection. The
next vessel, in point of time, which contained features answering
to the system now in vogue, and from the date of whose production
the movement has been almost constantly progressive,
was the screw-steamer <i>Fenton</i>, built by Messrs Austin &amp; Hunter,
of Sunderland, in 1876.</p>

<p>Clyde builders were not slow to recognise the value of the
system in its application to water-ballast steamers, and almost
immediately some of the more intrepid of their number began
to advocate its adoption, but with some modifications, in
vessels then being contracted for. Mr John Inglis, jun., of
Messrs A. &amp; J. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow, submitted to Lloyd’s
Registry in March, 1878, the scantling section of some cellular
bottom vessels, then in project, which contained several of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
improvements introduced in subsequent practice. Messrs
William Denny &amp; Brothers, of Dumbarton, at the same time
took up the principle, and have since actively applied it to
steamers of every character in which water-ballast is a
desideratum. Adopting it, five years ago, in four sister vessels
for the British India Steam Navigation Coy., they subsequently
raised the important issue with the Board of Trade regarding
the tonnage measurement of these vessels. This august body
insisted on computing the register tonnage—the figure upon
which the tonnage dues are levied—not to the top of the inner
bottom, but to an imaginary line half-way down the cellular
space—in fact, to where the line of floor would have been if
constructed in the ordinary fashion. Messrs Denny maintained,
in effect, that as the register tonnage was meant to be a
measure of the space available for cargo, the top of the ceiling
on the inner bottom was the only equitable line of measurement.
The principal reason for the Board seeking to pursue
this course seems to have lain in the supposition that owners
would endeavour to use the double bottom <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'for cargo-carrrying'">
for cargo-carrying</ins> purposes. An ambiguity in the words of the Merchant
Shipping Act, or their inapplicability to present day practice,
were other possible elements in the case, but doubtless the
red-tapeism and self-sufficiency characteristic of the Board
had much to do with their action. This is borne out by the
fact that although the Messrs Denny succeeded in their plea
with respect to vessels having structural cellular bottoms, the
absurd practice is still followed in cases where the bottom
is fitted for water ballast on the girder principle, <em>i.e.</em>—the
inner bottom fitted upon fore and aft runners or girders,
erected on floors of the ordinary description, as shown in Fig. 2.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig2" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <span class="fs80">FIG. 2.</span>
<img class="w100" src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="Cross section of hull">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>This formed, and still forms in many places, a very common
arrangement for water ballast steamers, although not so
inherent a feature of the vessel’s structure as the continuous-cellular
bottom. In most cases this system is fitted only for
part of the length, and not, like the cellular system, applied
throughout the whole length of the ship. If it was impossible
for the Board of Trade to hold by the contention that cargo
might be carried in bottoms of the structural cellular type, it
is equally untenable in the case of bottoms such as are now
referred to. The difference between the two kinds of ballast
bottoms is one merely of construction, and if any one of the
two lends itself to cargo-carrying purposes, it is certainly the
cellular system. The anomaly is sufficiently striking to merit
attention, and in certain districts where the girder system is
largely adopted for medium-sized vessels, it is felt as nothing
short of an injustice, both by shipowners and builders.</p>

<p>The concession or victory won by Messrs Denny removed a
serious hindrance to the spread and general adoption of the
water ballast cellular system. Other Clyde firms at the same
time—or at least soon after the adoption of the system by the
Messrs Denny—took the matter up and independently did
much towards the popularisation of the cellular mode of construction.
Speaking in the early part of 1880, Mr William
John, of Lloyd’s Registry, now General Manager with the
Barrow Shipbuilding Company, said:—“At the time Mr
Martell read his paper on water-ballast steamers before the
autumn meeting of this Institution (Naval Architects) at Glasgow,
in 1877, there had been only two or three small steamers
built (since Mr Scott Russell’s early ones) on the longitudinal
principle. Now, it is within the mark to say there are one
hundred steamers, built and building, whose bottoms are
constructed on the longitudinal principle, or what is better
described as the cellular system, amounting probably to
200,000 tons, and it is not outside the bounds of probability
that a very few years will see the majority of merchant
steamers constructed in this manner.” Mr John’s connection
with Lloyd’s at the time, entitled his statements and opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with regard to the prevalency and prospects of cellular construction
to be accepted with every assurance, for it is in such
Societies as Lloyd’s where <ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the best concensus'">
the best consensus</ins> of information
regarding the extent and tendencies of particular types of
vessels can be obtained. In point of fact, the intervening
period has witnessed, in great measure, a realisation of Mr
John’s forecast. The advantages of a cellular bottom as
regards safety, and for the purpose of ballasting and trimming
vessels, also as meeting the greater need for longitudinal
strength caused by the enormous growth in the size of vessels,
have received that appreciation from shipowners and shipbuilders
which is their due. The practice has accordingly
spread, till now, it would not be rash to say, quite as many
of the ocean-trading steamers being built are fitted with
cellular bottoms as are without them.</p>

<p>The adaptation of water ballast to sailing vessels, as well as
to steamers, has received consideration at the hands of both
Tyne and Clyde builders. Previous to 1877, several small
sailing ships were built on the Tyne, in which provision was
made for water ballast in tanks entering into the structure of
the bottom, but erected over the ordinary plate floors. About
150 tons of water ballast were carried by these vessels, the
filling and discharge of the tanks being effected by Downton’s
pumps, worked by the crew. The trade in which they were
engaged—<em>i.e.</em>—carrying coal from the Tyne to Spanish ports,
and back to this country with ore—was one in which the
introduction of water ballast proved commercially and otherwise
most advantageous. Two years subsequently Messrs A.
M‘Millan &amp; Son, Dumbarton, introduced water ballast into
one of the largest class of sailing vessels then being built.
Unlike previous sailing ships with provision for water ballast,
however, the vessel was constructed on the structural cellular
bottom principle, having bracket floors and continuous girders,
as so generally approved in steamships. Capacity for water
ballast, to the extent of over 300 tons was thus provided, the
filling and discharge being effected by a special donkey engine,
supplied with steam from a large donkey boiler. The boiler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
also furnished the motive power for cargo winches, off which,
by crank gear, the manual labour pumps were also brought
into requisition. Facilities for the expeditious management
of ballast—the want of which, in sailing vessels, considerably
hinders its adoption—were thus, in this case, efficiently provided.
Several other sailing ships, built by Messrs A.
M‘Millan &amp; Son, and by other shipbuilding firms on the
Clyde, have been fitted with this system, and the result of
experience with these vessels in actual service, thoroughly
encourages its more general adoption.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Many minor, yet aggregately important, structural features
which are products of the progressive movement of recent
years, or are simply revivals of old devices which were
“untimely born,” still call for some notice. As a necessary
consequence of the growth in dimensions and the change
in relative proportions of vessels, greater regard has been
paid to the systems of construction in which the longitudinal
principle is involved. This, of course, is evidenced
by what has been said of the cellular bottom system, but various
minor structural features associated with the cellular bottom
are also noteworthy in this connection. It is the practice,
for instance, where large ships are concerned, to fit side stringers
in the holds, throughout the entire length, made intercostal
with regard to transverse plate or web-frames occurring at
intervals of 16 or 20 feet, which extend from the bilge to the
main deck. This arrangement—an outline of which may be
found to the right of the section shown as Fig. 1—possesses
many structural advantages, and finds additional favour with
shipowners on account of its leaving a clearer hold for stowage
by obviating the use of transverse hold beams.</p>

<p>Regard for transverse strength has increasingly evinced itself
in the fitting of various kinds of plate side stiffeners or partial
bulkheads. This is well exemplified in a very recent case—that
of the National Company’s steamship <i>America</i>, built by
Messrs J. &amp; G. Thomson. This vessel, having been constructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
independent of any special Registry Rules, embodies structural
features not common amongst vessels in which such rules are
undeviatingly conformed to. The system referred to, of plate
frames or partial bulkheads, is one of the most conspicuous of
these features. Throughout the length of the vessel, at intervals
of about 18 feet, transverse plate stiffeners or frames,
extending from the shell inwards about 4 feet, take the place
of the ordinary angle frames, and are continuous from floors
to upper deck, the stringers and <ins class="corr" id="tn-20" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'other longtitudinal'">
other longitudinal</ins> features
being scored through them. The surplus transverse strength
resulting from this system is such as amply to compensate for
uncommonly large breaches made in the deck beams and
plating for light and air purposes in the saloons. This is a very
special feature in the interior arrangement of the <i>America</i>,
and will be referred to further on. The regard for transverse
strength, again, conjointly with the increased attention to
minute watertight sub-division, has led to the fitting of a
greater number of complete watertight transverse bulkheads,
relatively to the lengths of vessels.</p>

<p>In vessels of extreme proportions the method of forming
shells two-ply, or of fitting all the shell plates edge to edge
with outside covering-strakes over the fore-and-aft joints, has
been recently revived and much improved. The system,
although very expensive, has been adopted in vessels for the
Anchor Line by Messrs D. &amp; W. Henderson, Glasgow, and
subsequently on even a more extensive scale by the Barrow
Shipbuilding Company.</p>

<ins class="corr" id="tn-20a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'rivetting'">

extended application within recent years. Structurally, as
well as commercially, the system has played a large part in
the progressive movement under review. By its means the
strength of united parts has been enhanced through the increase
of their frictional resistance, and through the rigidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of joints, due to the more thorough filling of the rivet holes.
The subject of hydraulic or machine power <ins class="corr" id="tn-21" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'rivetting'">
riveting</ins> will, however, receive fuller treatment in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Within the past two or three years cast steel stems, stern-frames,
and rudders, have been taking the place of forged iron
work in ship construction. The practicability of manufacturing
these of such strength and homogeneity as would meet the
needs of ship construction even better than the ordinary forged
work, had occurred some five or six years ago to several
engaged in the steel trade. Mr J. F. Hall, of Messrs William
Jessop &amp; Sons, Limited, Sheffield, had the subject under consideration
about that period, and actually made several small
stern posts and rudders for steam yachts and launches. The
advantages of solid and uniform steel castings over iron
forgings—which, with their many weldings, so often prove
inefficient when subject to any sudden shock—were even then
rightly enough appreciated. It was only, however, after patents
had been taken out by Messrs Cooke &amp; Mylchreest, of Liverpool,
for various devices connected with the actual fitting of such
features to the ship’s structure—amongst other things the
hanging of rudders without pintles or gudgeons—that the
manufacture of cast steel stern-frames, rudders, &amp;c., was
seriously proceeded with.</p>

<p>In July, 1882, the Steel Company of Scotland (Limited),
who are the manufacturers in Scotland of Messrs Cooke &amp;
Mylchreest’s patent form of rudders and stern-frames, successfully
cast a stern-frame—the first of large size, it is believed,
made for actual use in the construction of a steamer. In
April of the same year, however, Messrs William Jessop &amp;
Sons (Limited), of Sheffield, had exhibited a crucible cast steel
stern-frame and rudder of their manufacture, at the Naval and
Sub-Marine Exhibition, held in London. These large castings,
along with others, were subjected to a series of tests in the
presence of Lloyd’s inspectors and other authorities, such as
the forged frames and rudders ordinarily fitted would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
have come through without severe damage, yet all of which
the steel castings withstood most thoroughly.</p>

<p>Testimony to the efficiency of these new features in ship
construction has already been furnished from the arena of
actual experience, by the recent grounding of two steamers in
which these features had been introduced. The screw-steamer
<i>Euripides</i>, a Liverpool-owned vessel of about 1780 tons gross,
completed in May, 1883, by Messrs Caird &amp; Purdie, of Barrow,
some time ago ran upon a reef of boulders, and remained
thumping heavily for several hours. At the time she was
laden with a full cargo of grain, which was afterwards delivered
in perfect condition. The cast steel stem and stern-frame,
which were manufactured by the Steel Company of Scotland,
were practically without damage, notwithstanding that serious
indentations were made in them. The stem, although receiving
the full force of resistance, was not perceptibly altered in shape,
and competent judges who inspected the damage in dock were
of opinion that the stem, with its superior attachments, in all
probability saved the vessel from total loss. The rudder on
the <i>Euripides</i> is of solid cast steel, in one piece, and hung
without pintles, and in a manner involving little or no
<ins class="corr" id="tn-22" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'rivetting'">
riveting</ins>. In this, as in the other features, the immunity from
serious damage testifies to the efficiency and durability of the
steel castings. The second case of grounding referred to is
that of the screw-steamer <i>Strathnairn</i>, of 400 tons, belonging
to Messrs James Hay &amp; Sons, of Glasgow; one of two vessels
built by Messrs Burrell &amp; Son, of Dumbarton, in which cast
steel stern-frames and rudders were adopted. This vessel got
aground while off Harrington, on the north-west coast of
England, about the latter end of March of the present year.
Her stern-frame sustained very considerable shock: such,
indeed, as no ordinary forged work could possibly have
undergone with like result. Subsequent docking showed
that it would only be necessary to straighten the frame at the
deflected portions in order to make it again structurally
efficient. This was done, and the vessel is again actively
engaged in service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>The weldless stern-frames, rudders, and stems, as patented by
Messrs Cooke &amp; Mylchreest, Liverpool, and manufactured for
them by the Steel Company of Scotland, Messrs Jessop &amp; Sons,
Sheffield, and Messrs John Spencer &amp; Sons, Newcastle, have
various advantageous features which may be noticed somewhat
fully. One of these is the casting of flanges on the
stern-posts, for attaching the shell plates to; by which arrangement
much of the difficult and costly work in the <ins class="corr" id="tn-23" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'rivetting'">
riveting</ins> and fitting of the shell plates at these parts is done away with,
while a considerable increase of strength is obtained. The
solid rudder is a great improvement on the built rudder
as usually fitted; the entire absence of rivets being an important
desideratum. The rivets connecting the rudder-plates to the
frame-forging are frequently a source of trouble and annoyance,
through their being loosened by the constant vibration
of the rudder, and the shocks it often receives. The heads of
the rivets not unfrequently drop off, and the rivets themselves
sometimes fall completely out. All this, of course, is entirely
obviated in the solid rudder. By Messrs Cooke &amp; Mylchreest’s
improved method of fitting the rudder—a device which
is only applicable in a casting—pintles are wholly dispensed
with, and in their place a much stronger joint is substituted,
with a considerably increased wearing surface. The rudder
is also jointed at the top of the blade, by means of strong
flanges bolted together; an obvious advantage of this arrangement
being that it can be readily unshipped, even when afloat.</p>

<p>In addition to the stern-frames, stems, and rudders, there are,
also being supplied, keels, garboard strakes, and centre keelsons
in long lengths. It is claimed for these that as the keel, garboard
strake, keelson, and brackets for connecting the floors, are
all made in one piece, they are much stronger than as ordinarily
constructed, and that a considerable saving in both labour and
rivets is effected. As there are no angle irons to contend with,
the limber-holes may be made close to the bottom plating, and
a much thinner layer of cement will, consequently, be needed
on the bottom; the saving in this respect, according to the
patentees’ calculation, being 50 tons in a 2,000-ton vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>As the prices of these frames and rudders do not exceed
those charged for frames of wrought-iron, and moreover, owing
to the pieces which are cast on to them forming attachments
for keels, decks, &amp;c.—thus cheapening the work of construction
in the shipyard—there appears to be no question of their
great superiority. The presence of blow-holes, not unfrequently
a source of misgiving in castings, is found from
experience to be a constantly diminishing fault in these
articles. The demand for them has steadily grown since
their adoption in a few actual cases. It would seem, indeed,
that the demand is only limited by the powers of production
possessed at present by the four or five steel-making firms
who have undertaken this class of work, and have satisfied
the requirements of the registration and the insurance societies.</p>

<p>In addition to the frames and rudders for ordinary screw
vessels, the Steel Company of Scotland have also supplied
several sterns for war vessels, with rams and torpedo openings,
which have proved very satisfactory. Other new adaptations
are the casting of large brackets for shafts of twin screw
vessels, of large crank shafts themselves, and of heavy
anchors; the results of tests presently being made fully warranting
the anticipation that the material will very largely be
employed in the future for these important items in the outfit
of merchant vessels.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The more important features of growth or change in ship
construction which have made the past few years a noteworthy
period in the history of mercantile shipbuilding have now
been reviewed. Speed, and propulsive power of steamships,
although absorbing very much of the progress for which the
period has been so remarkable, have not been dealt with, but
are reserved for the chapter following. The subjects named
will also necessarily receive some attention in the chapter
devoted to progress in the science of shipbuilding. In anticipation,
however, apologies should be offered for the paucity of
detailed references to the propulsive agents on board ship.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Marine engineering, in all its recent developments, would
require for its proper treatment considerably more space than
can be devoted to it in the present work.</p>

<p>To meet the exigencies of the progressive movement, both
practical skill, scientific knowledge, and commercial enterprise
have been needed on the part of our shipbuilders. These have
not been by any means wanting, as abundantly evidenced by
the foregoing record of what has been achieved. With a
continuance of that readiness displayed by shipbuilders and
naval architects to modify, and even revolutionize if need be,
types and methods which the times have outgrown, the lead
in merchant shipbuilding will long be ours. With <ins class="corr" id="tn-25" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'a maintainence also'">
a maintenance also</ins> of the enterprise shown by our shipowners,
Britain will still continue, as regards the number, size, and
power of her merchant ships, supreme among the nations.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="fs80">SPEED AND POWER OF MODERN STEAMSHIPS.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">In these days of feverish activity in every avenue of business,
when even leisure has come to be observed at a
much more accelerated <em>tempo</em> than formerly, speed in locomotion
would seem to be the first desideratum, not only on shore but
afloat as well. In no ocean service is the truth of this so
apparent as in the transatlantic mail and passenger service,
the oldest and most constantly progressive, and where at the
present time, certainly more than at any former period, the
contest for supremacy amongst rival steamship lines has
assumed the form of increased speed and enhanced passenger
accommodation.</p>

<p>The Atlantic service, for these reasons, as well as because
it exemplifies more of the fruits which have rewarded the
joint labours of the engineer and shipbuilder in improving
marine propulsion, may be selected for detailed review. In
other ocean services, of course, the achievements of engineering
and shipbuilding skill have also been made apparent, and
in ways, perhaps, which the Atlantic service does not exhibit.
Reference to these will afterwards be made, but attention will
meantime be confined to the service stated, and to such considerations
of the general progress made in ocean navigation
as are necessarily involved in the particular subject.</p>

<p>It is needless, in view of the frequency with which the story
of ocean steam navigation is told, and especially, considering
the scope of the present review, to enter at any length into
the details of early service. The first practically successful
transatlantic steamers were the <i>Sirius</i> and the <i>Great Western</i>,
the first a paddle-steamer 170 feet long, 270 horse-power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
originally constructed to ply between London and Cork, and
the latter, a paddle-steamer, 212 feet long and about 440
horse-power, designed and built expressly for the transatlantic
service. The <i>Sirius</i> left Cork on the 4th April, 1838, and
reached New York on the 22nd; the <i>Great Western</i> left
Bristol on the 7th April, three days after the <i>Sirius</i>, reaching
New York on the 23rd—the time taken being thus 18 days
and 15 days respectively. The return voyages of these pioneer
long-passage steamers were made in 16 days and 14 days
respectively, their performances at once establishing the
superiority of steamers, commercially and otherwise, over the
sailing ships which had previously for so long been the recognised
medium of transit in the Atlantic passenger trade.</p>

<p>In 1840 a regular mail service by steamers was first introduced
on the Atlantic. The first of these mail steamers was
the Cunard paddle-steamer <i>Britannia</i>, 207 feet long, which
sailed from Liverpool on July 4, 1840, and arrived at Halifax
in 12 days 10 hours, the return journey being performed in 10
days. The <i>Acadia</i>, <i>Columbia</i>, and <i>Caledonia</i> all of about the
same dimensions as the <i>Britannia</i>, at once followed. The
success of the Cunard Line was so marked that opposition was
soon provoked, and in 1850 the Collins Line of American
steamers started to compete with the Cunard liners. The
same year also saw the commencement of the well-known
Inman Company, of Liverpool, their first vessel being the <i>City
of Glasgow</i>, an iron screw-steamer of 1680 tons and 350 horse-power.
The Allan and Anchor Lines were established in 1856,
the Guion Line in 1863, and the White Star Line in 1870.</p>

<p>With the substitution of the screw propeller for the paddle
wheel, first carried out to any great purpose in the small
steamer <i>Archimedes</i> in 1839, but introduced with even greater
effect in the Atlantic steamer <i>Great Britain</i> in 1843, was laid
the basis of that progressive and magnificent success in propulsion
which has since attended ocean navigation. It was
with screw-steamers Mr Inman boldly assailed the Cunard
Company in 1850, but notwithstanding this, it was only in
1862 that the Government consented to sanction the use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the screw in the mail steamers of the Cunard Company. The
<i>Scotia</i>, measuring 366 feet in length, by 47½ feet in breadth,
and 30½ feet depth, launched in 1861, was the last paddle-steamer
built for this company.</p>

<p>The other great improvements contributing to the success
spoken of, were the introduction of engines designed on the
compound principle, and a little later, the employment of the
surface condenser, and the use of circular multitubular boilers.
In spite of the success with which the compound system was
attended in vessels built for the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company as early as 1856, and for some other private owners
soon after, the great steamship companies, and shipowners
generally, were very slow to adopt it. It was not until about
the year 1869 that the compound engine came into general
use, and it was only in 1872 that the Cunard Company
seriously took it into favour.</p>

<p>The early steamers of the Cunard Line possessed an average
speed of 8½ knots, and took about 15 days for the voyage.
Through the Collins rivalry the speed was increased to an
average of 12½ knots, and the time for crossing the Atlantic
was reduced to 12 days 9 hours outwards, and 11 days 11
hours homewards. In 1856, the powerful paddle-steamer
<i>Persia</i> (the first iron vessel built for the Cunard Company)
was placed on the service, and attained an average speed of
about 13 knots, consuming 150 tons of coal per day. She
made the distance between Queenstown and New York, on
an average, in 10½ days. In 1862 the <i>Scotia</i>, belonging to the
same company, made the passage in 9 days.</p>

<p>Coming down to more recent times, the White Star Line,
with its steamships <i>Britannic</i> and <i>Germanic</i>, built in 1874
and 1875 respectively, held for a considerable period first place
in the matter of fast steamships. The vessels named were,
however, in time beaten by the newer ships <i>Gallia</i>, of the
Cunard Line, and <i>Arizona</i>, of the Guion Line. As illustrating
the speed at which the vessels named accomplished the
transatlantic voyage—between Queenstown and New York—the
following brief list, compiled from published records, of fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
runs out and home during the period 1875-1881, may here
be given:—</p>

<p>When the success of vessels of the size of the <i>Arizona</i> and
the <i>Gallia</i> was made apparent, it was decided by the Cunard
Company to build a larger and faster ship than previous ones.
Accordingly, in the autumn of 1880, specifications were issued
to some of the leading shipbuilding firms, asking them to
tender for the construction of a vessel of 500 feet in length,
50 feet beam, and 40 feet depth. At the suggestion of Messrs
J. &amp; G. Thomson, who were successful in securing the contract
for this remarkable vessel, the dimensions were increased to
530 feet by 52 feet by 44 feet 9 inches. With these dimensions,
and with mild steel as the constructive material, the
new vessel—the <i>Servia</i>—was thereafter proceeded with in
Messrs Thomson’s establishment.</p>

<p>The Guion line, not to be left behind, placed the order for a
vessel of the dimensions first proposed for the <i>Servia</i>, with
Messrs John Elder &amp; Co., but, in order to be faster than the
<i>Servia</i>, the weight-carrying was considerably reduced, and the
boiler power much increased. The wisdom of this step has
been justified by the now generally received opinion that these
fast steamers should not carry such heavy cargoes as the slower
ones. This new vessel for the Guion line was the <i>Alaska</i>, now
justly noted for her fast runs across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The Inman Company also decided not to lag behind, and
as soon as the conditions of the design of the <i>Servia</i> had been
fixed, they placed the order for a ship—the <i>City of Rome</i>—with
the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, intended to be larger, finer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and faster. Expectations as to speed and carrying powers were
not in her case fulfilled, and the result of the dissatisfaction
which this occasioned, was, that the <i>City of Rome</i> changed
ownership, Messrs Henderson Brothers, of Anchor Line fame,
coming into possession. In the hands of its new owners, the
<i>City of Rome</i> was re-arranged internally, and her boiler power
was considerably augmented, while her engines also were
thoroughly revised. When first built, the vessel was fitted with
engines of 8500 horse-power. As revised, they indicate 12,000
the acquisition being largely due to the fitting of four additional
boilers. The results which have accrued from the extensive
alterations made are such as to have firmly established the
vessel in a foremost place in the Atlantic service.</p>

<p>The performances of the vessels named have been the subject
of considerable interest to all concerned in shipping affairs, and
to the public generally. The following table of fast passages
accomplished during the past two years by these vessels has
been compiled from published records, and from information
supplied by the shipowning companies:—</p>

<p>An addition to the list of competitors was made in the
<i>Aurania</i>, built by Messrs Thomson in 1882, and tried in June,
1883, when she attained a mean speed of 17¾ knots, and
showed herself not unequal to a maximum speed of 18½ knots
under circumstances ordinarily favourable. An untoward and
serious accident to her machinery laid the <i>Aurania</i> aside just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
as her capabilities in actual service were being shown. It is
during the “passenger season” that the qualities of these
transatlantic steamers are best brought out, and it remains
with the season which has just begun, to demonstrate to the
full the <i>Aurania’s</i> powers.</p>

<p>A similar remark applies to the <i>Oregon</i>, a still more recent
competitor from the same stocks as the <i>Alaska</i>, whose dimensions
correspond with those of the <i>Alaska</i>, except in respect
to breadth, the first-named vessel having 3-ft. 6-in. more beam
than the latter, the figures being—length over all, 520-ft.;
breadth, 54-ft.; depth, 40-ft. 9-in. Extra power of engines to
the extent of nearly 3000 horses indicated has been fitted in
the <i>Oregon</i>. On the occasion of her speed trial on the Clyde
she ran the distance between Ailsa Craig and Cumbrae Head—-29½
nautical miles—in 1 hour 20 minutes, or about equal to
20 knots per hour. This was attained with the engines indicating
12,382 horse-power and making 62 revolutions per minute,
the steam pressure being 110-lbs. per square inch. This result
was doubtless attained under conditions more favourable to
speed than the vessel is, as a rule, likely to meet with in actual
service; and, as has been indicated, it still remains with the
future to determine how far the aims of the owners and builders
of the <i>Oregon</i> are realised.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the <i>America</i>, launched from the yard of Messrs J. &amp; G.
Thomson, near the close of 1883, and presently being fitted for
sea, the National Steamship Company (Limited), of Liverpool,
have embodied the results of their careful study of the development
and changes in the mode of conducting the American
trade. From such experiments—for they can hardly be considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
anything else—as the rapid passages of the <i>Alaska</i>,
the <i>City of Rome</i>, and other “greyhounds of the Atlantic,” the
company see it is no longer possible or profitable to have
“composite” vessels—<em>i.e.</em>, those intended to carry a large cargo
as well as passengers,—but that practically one class of vessels
must be built for the passenger traffic and another for the
conveyance of cargo. The vessel represents an attempt to
solve the problem of producing a ship which shall have large
passenger accommodation and a high speed, with a comparatively
small first cost and a reasonable consumption of coal.
She is built of steel, and of the following dimensions:—Length,
440 feet; breadth, 51¼ feet; depth of hold, 36 feet;
gross tonnage, about 6,000 tons. Her engines are of the
inverted three-cylinder type, the high pressure cylinder being
63-ins. diameter, the two low pressure cylinders being 91-ins.
each, while the piston stroke is 66-ins. Six double ended
boilers and one single ended, having in all 39 furnaces, are
fitted. The power expected to be developed is about 9,000
indicated. The speed guaranteed by the builders of the
<i>America</i> is 18 knots an hour, and confidence is entertained by
all concerned as to this result being attained.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It is abundantly evident, notwithstanding what has already
been achieved, that the brisk competition among transatlantic
companies for the “fastest steamer afloat” has not yet exhausted
itself. The determination some time ago publicly expressed
by Mr John Burns, the able chairman of the Cunard Company,
to maintain a leading position, has since taken decidedly active
shape in the contract entered into and now being carried out
by Messrs John Elder &amp; Co.: that is, the construction of the
two huge and powerful steamers of unprecedented speed,
already referred to near the beginning of this work. They are
each of 8000 tons burthen, 500 feet in length, 57 feet broad,
by 40 feet depth of hold. Engines of 13,000 horse-power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
will be provided, which, it is computed, will drive the vessels
at a speed of 19 knots an hour. With the establishment of
these remarkable steamships in this most important service,
the prospect is near of a transatlantic passage lasting only six
days, if not indeed considerably under that period.</p>

<p>Communication with our South African colonies is another
service in which modern progress, as regards high speed, has
been conspicuously manifest. The steamers engaged in this
service—belonging to the Union Steamship Coy. and Messrs
Donald Currie &amp; Co.—had special attention directed towards
their powers as to fast steaming were exerted to the utmost
them during the Zulu War of 1879, at which juncture
in the transport of our soldiery. In the autumn of 1878 the
<i>Pretoria</i>, belonging to the Union Coy., made the outward
passage to the Cape, <em>via</em> Maderia, in 18 days, 16 hours, including
4½ hours detention. The passage home was made in the
autumn of 1879 by the same vessel in 18 days, 13¼ hours,
including about 5¾ hours stoppages. These passages are
fairly representative of the best performances of the vessels
engaged in this service, and they have not since been much
excelled. In midsummer, 1880, the <i>Durban</i>, another of the
Union Line vessels, accomplished the homeward run <em>via</em>
Maderia in 18 days, 9 hours, including about 6½ hours stoppages.
The <i>Drummond Castle</i>, belonging to Messrs Donald
Currie &amp; Co.’s Castle Packet line, has made the homeward run
in 18 days, 18 hours, or, excluding detentions, in 18 days, 13
hours. The <i>Hawarden Castle</i>, of the same line, has made the
fastest outward run on record. In the autumn of 1883 she
accomplished it in 18 days, 15 hours, including five hours
detention at Maderia, leaving the actual steaming time 18
days, 10 hours. The distance traversed by vessels on this
service is some 6,000 miles, and the average speed attained is
about 13 knots per hour. In the case of one of the Union
Coy.’s vessels, the average speed attained has been as high as
13·8 knots per hour over the greater portion of the voyage, the
indicated horse-power developed being about 2,570, and the
consumpt of coal about 52½ tons per day. For a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
time recently the Companies have found it more remunerative
to drive their vessels at moderate speed, but in times of
emergency, such as the outbreak of hostilities in our colonies,
their qualities as transports traversing long distances at high
speed are eminently efficient.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The employment of steamships in long voyages and at high
rates of speed, for which, not so long ago, it was generally supposed
sailing ships were only adapted, has been eminently
successful. By the opening of the Suez Canal the passage to
China was shortened from about 13,500 miles to about 9800
miles, that to India from over 10,000 miles to 6000. Although
steamers were running to China <em>via</em> the Cape of Good Hope,
before the opening of the Canal, and doing the service most
admirably, it is subsequent to that great change, and indeed
quite recently that the most noteworthy advances have been
made in shortening the time occupied on these important
services. The passage is now made by steamers under ordinary
circumstances in less than thirty days, which sailing ships
under the most favourable conditions took three and a half to
four months to accomplish. The average speed attained by the
steamers prior to the short route never exceeded ten knots;
steamers now frequently average twelve knots over the whole
distance, except during their passage through the Canal.</p>

<p>The <i>Stirling Castle</i>, built in 1882 by Messrs Elder &amp; Co., for
Messrs Skinner &amp; Co.’s China fleet, attained a speed of
18·4 knots on her official trial. During 1883 she proved herself
to be the fleetest vessel ever engaged in the China tea-carrying
trade, arriving in the Thames several days ahead of the China
mails, although the latter came part of the way overland. The
run from Woosung to London was made in 27 days 4 hours
steaming time. Other vessels belonging to this Company, and
vessels of the other lines on this important service, although
not equalling the performances of the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, are exemplifying
almost daily the immense superiority of steamers over
sailing ships for regularity and despatch in long passages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>As the distance to Australia—<em>i.e.</em>, some 12,000 miles as ordinarily
taken—is only about 900 miles less <em>via</em> the Suez Canal
than by the Cape of Good Hope, steamers are employed on both
routes. On the 12th May, 1875, the <i>St. Osyth</i> left Plymouth
for Melbourne <em>via</em> the Cape, called at St. Vincent for coal,
and thence steamed continuously to Melbourne, reaching her
destination on the 27th June. Her full steaming time was
about 43½ days, the average speed attained being over 11½
knots per hour. This passage, although considered most
remarkable at the time, has since been surpassed. The
<i>Lusitania</i>, of the Orient line, in 1877 made the passage to
Melbourne in 40¼ days, including a detention of 1¼ days at St.
Vincent while coaling. Her actual steaming time was almost
exactly 39 days, her average speed being only a trifle under
13 knots. The <i>Cuzco</i>, of the same line, during the summer of
1879, made the homeward passage from Adelaide to Plymouth
in 37 days 11 hours, including all detentions. In the <i>Orient</i>,
which was the first vessel specially designed and constructed
for the Australian direct steam service, a most noteworthy
step in advance was made. She was launched in September,
1879, from the yard of Messrs Elder &amp; Co., and on her completion
was tried for speed, when she attained a maximum
average speed of 17 knots per hour. She has made the passage
from Plymouth to Adelaide, <em>via</em> Suez Canal, in 35 days 16
hours, and the same voyage <em>via</em> Cape of Good Hope in 34
days, 1 hour, steaming time.</p>

<p>The <i>Orient</i> was followed in 1882 by the magnificent <i>Austral</i>,
whose high promise was suddenly blighted for a time by an
unfortunate accident. While coaling at her moorings in Sydney
harbour by night, the water was allowed to flow into the ship
through her after coal ports, carelessly left open and unwatched,
and she thus gradually filled, and sank to the bottom. She
has since been raised, brought home, and restored to her pristine
splendour. She is presently engaged in the express service
of the Anchor Line between Liverpool and New York, her
performances being such as should gratify all concerned. The
<i>Austral</i> on her trial attained a speed of 17·3 knots, and has
made the passage from Plymouth to Melbourne, <em>via</em> the Suez<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Canal, in the unprecedented time of 32 days, 14 hours steaming.</p>

<p>Until quite recently the only direct communication with
New Zealand has been by sailing vessels, but the New Zealand
Shipping Company (Limited) and the Shaw, Savill, &amp; Albion
Company (Limited) are at the present moment in the thick of
organising monthly services of high-class modern steamships to
the Antipodes. The former Company in 1883 despatched the
<i>Ionic</i>, which they had chartered, with other of the White
Star steamships, for the purpose. This vessel made the passage
out to New Zealand in 43 days, and home in 45 days, including
stoppage for coaling. Passages of a similar character have
been made by this vessel and others of the Company’s own
fleet, three of which—the <i>Tongariro</i>, <i>Aorangi</i>, and <i>Ruapehu</i>—are
splendid new steel vessels from the stocks of the famous
Fairfield yard. The vessel last named has just made the
passage home from Lyttelton, New Zealand, to Plymouth, in
the marvellously short period of 37 days, 20 hours, 40 minutes,
steaming time; the time, with detentions, being about 39 days.
The other Company referred to are having two magnificent
steel vessels built by Messrs Denny &amp; Bros., of Dumbarton, to
be named the <i>Arawa</i> and <i>Tainui</i>, each of 5000 tons gross. These
vessels are to maintain a sea speed of 12½ knots, the engines
to be fitted representing a noteworthy advance in the line of
economical consumpt of fuel with prolonged terms of steaming.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Between 1875 and 1882 the number of steamers having
ocean speeds of 13 knots and upwards, increased from twenty-five
to sixty-five. Of these there were only ten—previous to
1875—of 14 knots speed and upwards, whereas at the beginning
of 1882 there were twenty-five of this character. During
the years 1882 and 1883 alone the increase in the number of
such vessels has been almost double that for the previous
period named. The highest speed previous to 1875 did not
exceed 15 knots, now there are numerous vessels with speeds
exceeding 17 knots, several even approaching 18 knots, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in one or two cases the speed attained—under favourable
circumstances probably—is stated to have been considerably
over 18 knots, the Guion Liner <i>Oregon</i>, indeed, reaching the
round figure of 20 knots.</p>

<p>Viewed purely from the point of view of the sea voyager,
such results are alike remarkable and gratifying, whilst considered
in their technical and commercial aspects they also
call for admiration. It is questioned, however, whether in
most cases the attainment of great speed has been accompanied
with corresponding or proportionate advance in other matters
with which vital progress is concerned. Commercially, it is
of the utmost importance that increase of speed and power
should be achieved, with the least possible weight of machinery,
water, and fuel to be carried; with the least possible expenditure
of fuel; with safety and efficiency in working; with low
wear and tear, and cheapness of maintenance.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the ship and machinery in fulfilling the
various and often conflicting conditions of economical service is
a matter with which the naval architect and the marine engineer
have jointly to deal. Where the conditions cannot all be equally
satisfied, it is the province of these two to make that sort of
compromise which gives the best results in each special case.
In cargo-carrying vessels, for example, an economy in the
consumption of fuel may often be the dominant and regulating
quality. An economy of one-fourth of a pound per horse-power
per hour gives, on a large transatlantic steamer, a saving
of about 100 tons of coal for a single voyage. To this saving
of cost is to be added the gain in wages and sustenance of
the labour required to handle that coal, and the gain by 100
tons of freight carried in place of the coal. Again, it is
estimated that every ton of dead-weight capacity is worth on
an average £10 per annum as earning freight. Supposing,
therefore, the weight of machinery and water in any ordinary
vessel to be 300 tons, and that by careful design and judicious
use of materials the engineer can reduce it by 100 tons without
increasing the cost of working, he makes the vessel worth
£1,000 per annum more to her owners. To these and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
such considerations, which often influence the naval architect
and engineer in their designs, and due regard to one or more
of which not infrequently prevents the attainment of all-round
success, should be added many others concerned with
the after-management of vessels. For example, the length of
voyage to be performed, the seasons and the markets in
particular trades, the number of ports of call, and the coaling
facilities at each, are all matters which must be taken into
consideration when measuring, from one standpoint or from
particular instances, the degree of success attained in general.</p>

<p>The diminution in coal consumpt, coincident with the
increase of steam pressure and the acceleration in speed which
has been attained in recent years measures the principal
element of progress. In many of the “racers” of recent times,
it is true, speed is attained at what may appear a great sacrifice
of fuel, but these are cases in which the commercial considerations
often used to measure the efficiency of ordinary
cargo-carrying steamers are not applicable. Owners—of
transatlantic steamships especially—realise from experience
that “speed pays,” and they find it of more advantage to
ensure certainty of arrival at the port of destination than to
save a few tons of coals on the voyage.</p>

<p>During the past sixteen years or so the advance made in
respect to the reduced ratio of fuel consumed to power
developed has indeed been considerable. Before the period
stated a vessel of say 700 tons carrying capability was not
only much slower than the present-day vessels but the coal
supply amounted to about 16 tons per day of 24 hours, whereas
vessels are now being built of like size which attain an average
speed of 9 knots, the consumpt of coal not being more than 6
tons per day. In 1872 the consumption of coal in vessels
whose engines were worked at a pressure of from 45-lbs. to
65-lbs. per inch (the latter being then the highest pressure
recorded), did not exceed 2½-lbs. per indicated horse-power
per hour. This indicated an improvement in the marine engine
during the previous decade, represented by a reduction in the
consumpt of fuel by more than one-half the amount previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
thought indispensable. Since 1872, there has been a further
reduction in the average consumpt of fuel to the extent of
15 or 16 per cent., or in the average from 2⅛-lbs. to less than
1¾-lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour.</p>

<p>As in the case of the vessels themselves, mild steel is largely
taking the place of iron in the construction of marine boilers.
The change has reduced the weight of this important item of
machinery by about one-tenth, a great advantage in itself, as
increasing the dead-weight capability of the vessel. The
questions as to the reliable character of the boilers made of
steel with respect to strength under working, and as regards
corrosion, are being practically answered as time goes on; and,
as in the case of ship structure, in a way very satisfactory for
the new material. There is every probability that a further
advance may soon be made in connection with marine boilers,
in the way of constructing the shell in solid rings, thus doing
away with the longitudinal seams. The strength of boilers is
of course governed by the strength of the seam, and this is
never above 75 per cent. of the solid plate. Hence, if solid
shells are employed, an increase in pressure of about 25 per
cent., with the same thickness of shell, may be obtained.
Appliances are now being laid down in the Vulcan Steel and
Forge Coy., Barrow-in-Furness, for this purpose.</p>

<p>Improved appliances and modes of construction, no less than
the change of material employed, have played a large part in
rendering the boilers of modern steamships capable of being
worked at the higher pressures now common. It is not
possible, however, with the space at command, to treat of
these; nor is it practicable to consider or even enumerate all
the various improved fittings which in the aggregate so
materially enhance the efficiency of boilers.</p>

<p>One such feature particularly noteworthy because of the
success with which it has been applied to the boilers of very
many modern high-class merchant ships may be shortly
referred to. This is the corrugated mild steel furnace, manufactured
by the Leeds Forge Company on Mr Samson Fox’s
patent, an illustration of which is given in Fig. 4.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
This shows a single corrugated furnace flue, flanged at the
end to meet the tube plate of the boiler. The strength of these
flues to resist collapse has been proved in the presence of the
officials of the Admiralty, Board of Trade, and Lloyd’s Register,
to be, on the average, four times greater than a plain flue of
the same dimensions. An immediate effect of this has been
to increase their average diameter from 3-ft. to 4-ft., the
thickness of plate-½-inch—remaining the same; a result as
to diameter and thickness quite impracticable with ordinary
furnaces. Some have even been made to carry 170-lbs. per
square inch of steam pressure, 4-ft. 8-ins. outside diameter
constructed of one single plate, with the weld so arranged as
to be below the fire bars in the furnace.</p>

increased heating surface is presented to the flame and the
heated gases of the furnace, thus yielding a greatly enhanced
evaporative power, equal to at least 50 per cent. more than in
the ordinary form. Better allowance is made by the corrugated
surface for the expansion and contraction caused by changes
of temperature in the furnace, without in any way impairing
its efficiency as a longitudinal stay for the boiler. Through
the increased diameters and the augmented surface possible
by these corrugated tubes, their adoption lessens the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of furnaces and stokers necessary for the horse-power required.
As a further consequence, the boiler space may be diminished,
and an increase effected in the cargo space or freight-carrying
capacity of the vessel.</p>

<p>The advantages of corrugated flues as compared with
plain flues cannot all be named, but the extraordinary
extent to which they are now employed in the best class of
steamships is the best proof of their superiority. It is stated
that if the flues which have been made by the Company since
their introduction about the beginning of 1878, and are now
at work, were placed in one continuous line, they would
extend to a length of over twenty miles, representing, in marine
and other engines, nearly one million horse-power.</p>

<p>The number of separate types of boilers introduced into
steamships has been much increased of recent years—an
evidence that engineers are growingly conscious of the possibilities
which may result from improved efficiency in this
agent of propulsion. One direction in which their efforts at
present are being largely put forth, is that of securing the
more complete combustion of fuel in the furnaces. Considerable
success has already attended the working of boilers under
forced draught, or the admission of air to the furnaces under
pressure. Combined with special types of boilers, it has been
affirmed that nearly 50 per cent. more power has been
obtained by this means. There is doubtless much to be
expected from this system in the future, especially as it may
be associated with a change in the form or type of boilers by
which the number and weight of such items will be reduced.
The saving of space in the vessel, the economy in
<ins class="corr" id="tn-42" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'comsumption of coal'">
consumption of coal</ins>, the reduction in dead-weight of machinery, are possibilities
of the movement now in progress which cannot fail to
effect materially the commercial character of our high-class
mail and passenger steamships, and merchant vessels generally.</p>

<p>Other directions in which advance has been made during
the period under review are, considerably higher steam pressures,
less heating surface, and smaller cylinders, for indicated horse-power
developed. The various improvements in design and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
construction which have contributed to these results cannot
be entered into with any degree of fulness here. For detailed
treatment of these matters, readers are referred to the papers
read by eminent engineering authorities, before the various
professional and scientific institutions, a list of which papers
follows the present chapter.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Reduction in the weight of machinery per indicated horse-power
developed is, in general terms, the common line in which
engineering effort lies, and in which no little advance has
lately been made. Every possible opportunity of using steel,
where it can be introduced with safety and efficiency, has
been taken advantage of. Hollow crank steel shafts and propeller
shafting in place of solid shafting; propellers and pistons
of cast steel in place of iron; and boilers of mild steel plates,
are a few of the directions in which large weight-savings have
been effected. That there is still great room for improvement
in this direction is shown by the following statement, given by
Mr F. C. Marshall, of Messrs R. &amp; W. Hawthorn, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
in his valuable paper read before the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers in 1883. The figures given show for
various classes of vessels the average weight of machinery per
indicated horse-power, in steamships of the merchant marine—and
for comparison—of the Royal Navy:—</p>

<p>One of the most important of recent advances in marine
engineering—affording as it does the means of using higher
steam pressures than have hitherto been used with economy—is
the introduction of the triple expansion description of
engines already referred to. This important departure was
begun in 1874, when Mr A. C. Kirk, of Messrs R. Napier &amp;
Sons, designed and fitted on board the screw-steamer <i>Propontis</i>,
built for Mr W. H. Dixon, of Liverpool, by Messrs
Elder &amp; Co.—with whom Mr Kirk at that time was engineering
manager—engines involving the principle of triple expansion
and abnormally high pressure of steam. In 1877 the
principle received further practical development on board the
<i>Isa</i>, a pleasure yacht fitted with triple expansion engines,
designed in 1876 by Mr Alexander Taylor, consulting engineer
of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who has subsequently designed several
other engines of the same type for larger merchant steamers.</p>

<p>As not infrequently happens in connection with inventions,
several minds were occupied, and independent ideas matured
almost simultaneously, in the matter of triple expansion
engines. Mr Kirk had secured the patent for engines involving
this principle subsequent to, but before he was made cognisant
of, Mr Taylor’s work. At the same time he learned that in
quite another quarter the designs for such a type of engine had
already been perfected. Mr Kirk, on hearing these facts,
relinquished the patent rights he had secured. Notwithstanding
this, it is to the success of the engines designed by Mr
Kirk, and fitted by his firm on board the screw-steamer
<i>Aberdeen</i>, that the recent development of the system is largely
due. This vessel was built in 1881 for the Australian service
of Messrs G. Thomson &amp; Co., London and Aberdeen, and
measures 350 feet by 44 feet by 33 feet. Her engines work
at a boiler pressure of 125 lbs. per square inch. The three
cylinders are respectively 30 inches, 45 inches, and 70 inches
in diameter, and the stroke is 4 feet 6 inches. The smallest
is the high pressure cylinder, into which the steam is first
admitted; from thence it passes, after expansion, into the
second or intermediate cylinder; after still further expansion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
it passes into the third or low pressure cylinder, from whence,
after the expansion is completed, it is discharged into the
condenser.</p>

<p>When the <i>Aberdeen</i> was completed, 2,000 tons of dead-weight
were put on board, and the consumption was tested on
a four hours’ run at 1,800 horse-power. The result was the
consumption at the rate of 1.28-lbs. per indicated horse-power
per hour, with Penrikyber Welsh coal. From this the designer
of the engine inferred a sea consumption of good Welsh coal
at the rate of 1·5 to 1·6-lbs. per indicated horse-power. The
maximum measured mile speed was 13·74 knots, with 2,631
indicated horse-power, and a consumption of 1 ton 17 cwt.
per hour. The vessel started from Plymouth on 1st April,
1881, upon her first voyage to Melbourne, with 4000 tons of
coals and cargo—weight and measurement—on board. She
arrived at Cape Town on the 23rd April, having accomplished
the distance—5,890 miles—in 22 days. After taking in about
140 tons of coal, she left for Melbourne on the 24th, and
arrived there on the 14th May, in 20 days. The whole time
occupied in steaming from Plymouth to Melbourne was, therefore,
42 days. Her average indicated horse-power on the
voyage has been about 1,880, and the consumption less than
thirty-four tons per day, or at the rate of about 1·69-lbs. per
indicated horse-power over the whole voyage. Since these
results were obtained, Messrs Napier have fitted three sets of
5000 <span class="allsmcap">H.P.</span> triple expansion engines into vessels built for the
Compania Transatlantica Mexicana, and are completing a
duplicate of the <i>Aberdeen</i>.</p>

<p>The firm of Messrs Denny &amp; Coy., Dumbarton, are at present
making engines of the triple expansion type for the new
steamers of the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Company’s direct New
Zealand service. There are four cylinders and two cranks,
the cylinders being arranged in pairs, tandem fashion, the
small on the top of the large. Expansion takes place in three
stages, the first small cylinder taking steam from the boilers
about five-eights of the stroke, and expanding into the valve
chest of the second small cylinder, where it is further expanded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
From thence it exhausts into the valve chest common to both
the large cylinders described. The steam to be supplied to
these engines is to have a pressure of 160-lbs. per square inch,
the highest yet carried in marine engines. These instances
of actual advancement, taken in conjunction with the favourable
light in which the triple expansion principle is regarded
by our foremost marine engineers, augur well for the future
of steamship propulsion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The activity characterising merchant ship construction,
and especially the enormous increase in their dimensions
and speed within recent years, have necessarily led to speculation
with regard to what form the ship of the future will
take. There have not been wanting, indeed, actual propositions
and elaborately prepared designs of what the ideal ship should
be. A company was sometime ago formed in Washington,
U.S., to have three vessels built of a novel type, the patented
invention of Captain Lundborg, a Swedish engineer, intended
to make the Atlantic passage in five days. It was also
announced that the order for their construction had actually
been given out, but this is wanting in confirmation. Great
expectations were entertained in America regarding what was
termed the dome-ship <i>Meteor</i>, built on the Hudson in the
early part of 1883 from the designs of Captain Bleven. A
company had been formed under the designation of the
“American Quick Transit Company,” the chief supporters
being Boston merchants, to build several large steamships on
the proposed lines, but the utter failure of the <i>Meteor</i> to answer
the promises of her inventor has relegated the scheme to the
vast limbo of unfulfilled American projects. Three years ago
or more, scientific journals gave publicity to a scheme of “Ocean
Palace” steamship, patented by Mr Robert Wilcox, of Melbourne,
Victoria, the claims for which ranked themselves under
the heads of speed, safety, and comfort. Double hulls, as in
the case of some Channel steamers, were employed, but each
of the hulls was divided into two cigar-shaped portions, thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
giving to the submerged whole, a quadruplicate character, and
which, with its palatial superstructure, was apt to remind one—shall
it be said?—of Rome and her seven hills, or Venice
and her island base! The design, nevertheless, was to give the
least resistance with the greatest buoyancy and stability.
The method of propulsion proposed by Mr Wilcox was also
novel. He placed a couple of enormous drums fore and aft
(between the hulls), which were to be driven by the engines as
if they were paddle-wheels. Over these drums was placed a
continuous band of iron links, upon which, at suitable intervals,
paddles or blades were fixed. A comparatively low speed of
engine was to give a high speed of velocity to this band of
blades; and as there would be twenty-one paddles, all immersed
at the same time, their grip of the water was to be such that
there should be little slip. Whether on a serious application
of the principles involved in this invention to a ship for the
Australian service the voyage would have been made, as was
claimed, in 26 days, equal to an increase in speed of 75 per
cent., has never of course been determined! Still another
scheme, and one which the inventor has been encouraged to
prosecute by the recommendations of eminent authorities on
both sides of the Atlantic, is that of Captain Coppin, noted
for his success in salvage operations, which consists of an
“Ocean Ferry” partaking as to form somewhat of the features
above described for Mr Wilcox’s “Ocean Palace.” The speed
said to be possible by Captain Coppin’s vessel is twenty knots
an hour, and the terminal ports proposed are Milford Haven
and New York. It was announced some time ago that M.
Raoul Pictet, the eminent engineer of Geneva, was engaged
upon the question of ship design and propulsion, and was in
hopes that by application of his ideas he might yet send ships
careering over the sea at the rate of thirty-seven miles an hour!</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that there is no lack of inventive
effort being put forth towards a realization of the ideal
ships of the future. In a service, however, like that of the
Atlantic, where competition is strong and keen, and where
the monetary issues are neatly adjusted between rival companies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
there is little chance of any of the various projects
being tried. An impression exists among shipowners—for
which doubtless there are sufficient grounds—that time and
capital staked on novelties or “new departures” are simply
invitations to defeat in the race or to absolute ruin itself. This
commercial prudence and industrial caution has been startled
in several ways of recent years—<em>e.g.</em>, by meteoric flashes such as
the <i>Livadia</i> and <i>Meteor</i>—the ultimate effect of which has been
to illumine and make clearer the probable line of advancement.</p>

<p>By pretty general consent of those most competent to judge
the ships of the immediate future will possess the broad
distinctions of being either purely passenger or purely cargo-carrying
mediums. It is equally agreed that twin in place
of single screw propellers will be employed, and that for the
express ships nothing less than 20 knots per hour will be
considered satisfactory. On a subject, however, concerned not
with historical facts, but with theories and scientific forecasts,
it may be well not to enlarge, especially as the future is
evidently charged with possibilities of which present-day
designers can have but indefinite notions. The subject of
employing electrical energy as the propulsive power on board
ship is at the present time engaging serious attention, but the
degree of practical and commercial success attained does not,
as yet, warrant any anticipation of its immediate application
to vessels beyond small craft, such as launches and ferries. In
the midst, however, of such immense and marvellous works
achieved by this great—and, in some senses, modern—force,
it would be both idle and unwise to keep out of view the possibilities
of its future as affecting ship propulsion.</p>

<span class="fs80">SAFETY AND COMFORT OF MODERN STEAMSHIPS.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Every advance—whether it be in dimensions or power of
steamships, or whether it consist of modifications in
their structure or appointment—toward that ideal period when
sea-voyaging will have attained its maximum of comfort and
its minimum of risk, is deserving of record. The qualities of
safety and comfort, even more than increase of speed and
the consequent shortening of sea passages, are first essentials
in the realisation of this great end. The structural modifications,
and the great development in size of recent vessels, affect
the qualities named in ways which already may have been
made evident, but which call for more detailed treatment.
The more minute watertight sub-division of the hulls of
vessels, for instance, and especially the presence of an inner
skin or cellular bottom, are <ins class="corr" id="tn-51" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'marked accesions to'">
marked accessions to</ins> their safety.</p>

<p>The primary object and ruling principle of all proper watertight
sub-division, is so to limit the space to which water can
find access, that in a vessel with one, or even two, compartments
open to the sea, the accession of weight due to the
filling of these compartments would not exceed the surplus
buoyancy she should possess. Until within recent years
this was not so fully regarded as it ought, owing chiefly to
the objections of shipowners to minute sub-division, as
impairing a vessel’s usefulness and capacity for stowage of
miscellaneous cargo. These objections have still doubtless
much weight for vessels in certain trades, but the tendency
of modern passenger traffic to estrange itself from cargo-carrying
mediums, makes them almost inapplicable to a large
section of our mercantile marine. There is now, indeed, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
faith in well divided ships generally as being in the long run no
less efficient and more economical than scantily divided ones.</p>

<p>The salutary influence exerted by the Admiralty, in stipulating
for increased sub-division of the hulls of all merchant
vessels eligible for state employment in times of war,
worthy of special recognition. A few years ago only
thirty or forty large steamers in the merchant navy were so
constructed, as regards sub-division, that they would have
survived for a few minutes the effect of collision with other
vessels or of grounding on rocks. Within recent years—greatly
owing to the stipulations referred to, and to the desire
f shipowners to comply with them for the reasons given—there
are few, if any, of the many first-class mail steamers
turned out, not so constructed.</p>

<p>Much valuable information on the subject was given in a
paper on “Bulkheads,” read before the Institution of Naval
Architects in March, 1883, by Mr James Dunn, of the
Admiralty, whose experience in matters relating to the qualification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
of merchant ships for State employment eminently
entitles him to be considered an authority. From diagrams
contained in the paper, the effects of good and of inefficient
sub-division of vessels are well illustrated. Figs. 5 to 8 in
the present work represent some of these. They are concerned
with two vessels, in one of which—an actual case—the bulkheads
were well placed and cared for, and carried to a reasonable
height as shown in Fig. 5; the result of a collision
proving that under such conditions they were of immeasurable
value, while in the other vessel, although having the same
number and a similar disposition of bulkheads, their presence
is rendered valueless by their being stopped at or about the
water-line, as indicated in Fig. 7. In the first case, a steamer
of nearly 5,000 tons, during a fog, ran into the vessel represented
by Fig. 5 and 6, striking her abreast of No. 3 bulkhead,
and opening up two compartments to the sea. The bulkheads,
however, as has been said, were carried to a reasonable height,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and the water could not get beyond them—they stood the
test—the vessel did not sink, but kept afloat at the trim
shown in Fig. 6, and in this condition steamed 300 miles
safely into port. The second case—though a suppositionary
one merely, yet representative of not a few merchant steamers
now afloat—would not be attended with like results should
such an accident happen as has been described. In vessels
so bulkheaded, the water not being confined to the two holds,
numbered 2 and 3, as it was in the previous actual case, would
pour over the top of the dwarf bulkhead into the foremost
hold, and the ship would soon assume the position indicated
in Fig, 8: one not at all favourable, as may be readily believed,
for the completion of a voyage to port.</p>

<p>These cases illustrate the value of minute and careful sub-division
of the hulls of vessels by watertight bulkheads.
Unless, however, the bulkheads are carried a few feet higher
than the level of the water outside—and it is to be regretted
that this is still not infrequently overlooked or neglected in
merchant steamers—they are valueless, and, indeed, had better
not be in the ship at all. They will contribute to the loss of
the vessel by keeping the water at one end, and carrying her
bows under, whereas if they are not fitted, the same volume
of water will distribute itself throughout the bottom of the
ship fore and aft, preserve the even trim of the vessel, and
allow more pumps to cope with the inflow. Although her
freeboard, or height of side above water will be reduced, she
will still be seaworthy, the boiler fires may be kept burning,
and the machinery going, sufficiently long for her to reach a
port of safety. Readers appreciating the above considerations
will readily see why it is that sailing vessels are usually fitted
with only one transverse bulkhead—that near the bow—and
understand how it is that the outcry sometimes made by
inexperienced people about the absence of other bulkheads in
emigrant sailing vessels is for most part unheeded by those
on whom the responsibility falls.</p>

<p>From statistics presented in the paper above referred to, it
is shown that during a period of six years, ending with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
December, 1882, the average loss per annum of ships not
qualified for the Admiralty list was one in twenty-five; while
of ships so qualified the annual average loss was only one in
eighty-six. The chances of loss from any cause are thus seen
to be nearly four times as great for a ship not constructed to
qualify for the Admiralty list as for a vessel entered on that
list. During the first four-and-a-half years of the period
referred to, not one ship of those entered on the list was lost
by collision although a considerable number had been in
collision, and escaped foundering by reason of the safety
afforded by their bulkheads. During 1882 six casualties
happened to ships on the list, one of which—a case of collision—proved
fatal. This was a case, however, such as no merchant
steamer afloat at the time would have been capable of surviving.
The whole of the ship—a small one—was flooded abaft
the engine-room, the two after holds being open to the sea.
The whole of the losses from the Admiralty list during the
period referred to—eleven in number—have been from drifting
on rocks, or otherwise getting fixed on shore, with the
solitary exception above quoted. In the same period 76 ships
have been lost which had been offered for admission to the
list, but had not been found qualified; of these 17, or 22½
per cent., were lost by collision; and 10, or 13¼ per cent.,
were lost by foundering; most of the rest stranded or broke
up on rocks. The risk of fatal collision, according to Mr
Dunn, is about 1 to 100, irrespective of the class of ship, and
the ships on the Admiralty list enjoy almost absolute immunity
from loss by this cause.</p>

<p>The foregoing indicates the way in which minute water-tight
sub-division has come to be widely regarded. Much
requires yet to be done to reach the end desirable, as there
are many vessels built prior to the movement sadly deficient
in the qualities concerned. The bulkhead near the bow—the
“collision” bulkhead, as it is termed—has done noble service
in many cases of collision, and it is with reason that its
position and structural character in all vessels are subject to
special supervision and made a condition of classification in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the Registries. Recently it has been made imperative by
Lloyd’s Society that vessels over 330 feet long should have
two additional water-tight bulkheads extending to the upper
deck, in the holds, forward and aft of the machinery compartment.
The requirements of this Registry, it may be said,
constitute at once an anticipation and a reflex of the needs of
merchant ship construction. In water-tight sub-division, as in
other matters, the Society and its large staff of able surveyors
are “powers which make for” sterling efficiency.</p>

<p>The extended adoption of double bottoms is specially contributory
to the safety of vessels in the event of their running
over a reef into deep water, or in going ashore. Numerous
instances are on record of steamships so constructed sustaining
damage to the outer skin, and yet—because of the inner
bottom remaining intact and perfectly water-tight—no serious
damage resulting. The case of the <i>Great Eastern</i> is an early
yet notable example. This great vessel in 1860 ran over a
reef of rocks and tore a hole 80 feet long and 10 feet wide in
her outer skin, yet, because of this feature in her construction,
she was placed in no jeopardy.</p>

<p>In this connection it would seem that even the employment
of steel as the constructive material affords safety to a vessel
in circumstances which would almost prove fatal to a ship
built of iron. The remarkable experience which befell the
first steel ocean-going steamer—the <i>Rotomahana</i>, belonging to
the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand—may here be
recounted. While steaming between Auckland and the Great
Barrier Island on New-Year’s-Day, 1880, this vessel struck
upon and ran over a sunken rock. She had a large party of
pleasure seekers on board, and but for the fact that she was
built of such a ductile material as mild steel, the commencement
of the year 1880 might have been clouded by a
catastrophe which would have spread gloom and sorrow
throughout New Zealand, if not over a wider circle. At the
earliest possible moment the damaged vessel was docked for
examination. The results are effectively summarised in an
extract from a letter referring to the accident, written by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
managing director of the Company. He says:—“This experience
has clearly shown the immense superiority of steel over
iron. There is no doubt that had the <i>Rotomahana</i> been of
iron, such a rent would have been made in her, that she would
have filled in a few minutes.” The starboard bilge for over
20 feet of its length was more or less indented, one plate
especially being greatly misshapen between two frames. This
plate was removed, hammered, rolled flat again, and replaced—after
the frames which had been bent inwards by the force
of the grounding had been straightened. No new material
except rivets were required for the execution of the repairs.
The <i>Rotomahana</i>, as if to show her ability to “laugh at all
disasters,” has grounded twice subsequently on the rocky and
treacherous coast along which she plies, yet has come out of
the ordeal with immunity from positive danger. Her remarkable
experience may safely be taken as most convincing evidence
of the suitability of mild steel for shipbuilding. Other cases
are not wanting, however, in which the same thing is exemplified.
One which recently astonished everybody concerned
with shipping was that of the <i>Duke of Westminster</i>, a vessel
400 feet in length, built of mild steel by the Barrow Shipbuilding
Coy., which lay bumping for a week on stony ground
near the Isle of Wight, without making a drop of water.
The bottom plating of the <i>Duke of Westminster</i>, as she appeared
in dry dock, was corrugated between the frames for more than
half the length of the vessel, and yet not a single plate was
cracked, nor a rivet started. Another case of an equally
striking character is that of the British India Coy.’s steamer
<i>India</i>, built <ins class="corr" id="tn-57" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'by Messsrs Denny'">
by Messrs Denny</ins>, of Dumbarton, which went
ashore near the mouth of the Thames in December, 1881, and
was left high and dry at low water. Her bottom, although
forced up about 3 inches over a length of about 40 feet amidships,
did not give way, and the vessel, during the period she
was aground, did not make a drop of water.</p>

<p>All these are instances of the enhanced safety of ships due
to the employment of steel, which ought certainly to be recognised
by underwriters in the way of reduced premiums for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
vessels constructed of this material. One consideration which,
it is both curious and sad to say, militates against this result,
and which, judging from views entertained by shipowners
themselves, stands in the way of the employment of steel, is
not its <em>inability</em> but its very <em>efficiency</em> to withstand the results
of grounding or other catastrophe. It is argued that while the
effects of grounding are less <em>severe</em> in the case of steel, and do
not result in fracture or through-piercing because of
<ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'its great ducility'">
its great ductility</ins>, yet the amount of <em>damage requiring repair</em> is invariably
much greater than in the case of iron. This view of the
matter—which virtually places pounds, shillings, and pence
before the comfort, if not the very lives, of those on board
ship—the author feels bound to say, is not, so far as he knows,
shared by owners of ships engaged in mail and passenger
service, and it cannot surely be entertained by underwriters
of any proper discernment.</p>

<p>Safety in ocean steamships, in so far as affected by design,
has unquestionably received greater attention at the hands of
designers within recent years than formerly. The particular
directions in which this is evinced, as well as the causes at
work in bringing it about, will be dealt with in the chapter
on scientific progress, the object here being to indicate the
extent to which the safety of ships is affected by the qualities
of their construction and outfit. The general question of
seaworthiness, affected as it is by matters almost beyond
the province of the marine architect, is in great measure the
care of others concerned. The underwriting or insurance societies
looking to their own interests, the Board of Trade on behalf
of the lieges, and shipowners on their own and their customers’
and servants’ account, are parties on whom responsibility
devolves in this connection. The question whether they are
duly, and at all times alive to such responsibility, is one very
difficult to answer, and cannot be fully dealt with here. Apart
from the question of remissness by these bodies, in what are
clearly their special duties, there is great difficulty in apportioning
the duties and responsibility aright. The Board of Trade
have not infrequently received checks when with precautionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
motives they have interfered with departments and in matters
but little affecting a vessel’s seaworthiness. The conflict which
has so long raged and still rages between the Board and the
shipowners of Britain regarding the loading of vessels, illustrates,
and is indeed the result of, both difficulties. The
Merchant Shipping Bill, introduced by Mr Chamberlain, and
in a modified form now before Parliament, will, it is hoped,
furnish a satisfactory solution of the matter. Shipowners
themselves have too often insisted on exercising functions and
dictating in matters which only may be determined with propriety
and safety by builders or by competent naval architects.</p>

<p>The amount of thorough supervision to which a vessel is
subjected while under construction, renders the fear of unseaworthiness,
from either defective construction or equipment,
the least reasonable of all the fears with which ocean navigation
is regarded. It is in later circumstances, and concerning matters
of a more extraneous character, that the most justifiable fears
may be entertained regarding a vessel’s safety. Overloading,
improper stowage, bad management, under-manning, insufficient
repair, besides the numerous inevitable and unforeseen
circumstances incidental to sea-voyaging, may be instanced as
the causes to which the greatest losses are attributable.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Few instances of loss from structural defects are adduceable,
and even in these, causes of a more or less extraneous character
are associated with the loss. On the other hand, instances
could be multiplied where vessels sustaining the casualties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
which rough weather or rank carelessness make always
imminent have come out of the ordeal with credit to the
constructors. One notable case may be instanced. The
<i>Arizona</i>, of the Guion Line, some time after being put on the
Atlantic service, while steaming at a speed of 14 knots, and
almost in mid-Atlantic, ran into an iceberg of gigantic dimensions,
and notwithstanding that the force of the concussion
smashed her bows for a length of 20 feet into an unrecognisable
mass, she kept afloat, and reached a port of safety.</p>

<p>Where, as has already been indicated, there is such close
oversight and thorough supervision—where, indeed, the real
interests of every party honestly concerned lie so clearly in
the high qualities of construction—nothing short of such
results as the foregoing should be expected. The insurance
companies, on whom the burden (monetary at least) of loss
at sea ultimately falls, see it their interest to know that those
registration societies, on whom they rely for guarantee as to a
vessel’s structural and general efficiency, are themselves efficient
and trustworthy authorities. These societies, known as
Lloyd’s, Liverpool Underwriters, and Bureau Veritas, Registries,
in spite of the dread as to business rivalry affecting injuriously
their standards of classification, have still a high criterion, and
enjoy the confidence of insurance societies and shipowners alike.</p>

<p>Shipowners themselves, notwithstanding some examples to
the contrary, are, and have always been, anxious and painstaking
seekers after thoroughness; not merely mercenary
grubs, sacrificing considerations of safety to features promising
exemption from tonnage or other registration dues, and perhaps
the extinction of a rival. Some of the best British vessels,
notably those of the Cunard Line, are unclassed at the registries,
but have been built under private survey. The well
known boast of the Cunard Company that not a single life
has been lost by mishap at sea during their long and extensive
service, is eloquent testimony to the care exercised in the
construction and management of ships. It is the practice of
some companies to effect classification in two, sometimes
three, separate registries, and the number of inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
employed to superintend the work of construction, over and
above the surveyors of the registries and the overseers of the
firms, is in some instances astonishing. The crowning case
of all is that of the building firms themselves—many shipbuilders
unquestionably being conscientious and thorough to a
degree which simply mocks this great array of supervision.</p>

<p>In the outfit of vessels correspondingly close attention is
paid to those features, fixed or portable, which contribute to
the safety of the ship and the welfare of passengers. The
universal adoption of steam winches for working cargo enables
the pumps communicating with the holds to be wrought by
steam, through levers attached to the barrel ends of the
winches. Special donkey-engine pumps, in addition, are now
employed in all the higher class vessels, and automatic means
of registering the quantity of water in the holds are beginning
to be introduced. Provision against outbreaks of fire, no less
than against foundering, has been receiving greater attention
than formerly. Many of the first-class mail steamships are
fitted with fire-pipes leading to every compartment, and which
convey at the turning of a valve a charge of steam sufficient
to extinguish the most serious outbreak. Lowering and
detaching gear for life-boats is now a necessary part of every
first-class steamer’s equipment. Over a dozen different apparatuses
for effecting this very important purpose are at present
in the market, some of which are admirably adapted for safe
and speedy working, even in the hurry and panic which too
often accompanies cases of shipwreck.</p>

<p>Important as these devices are for saving life and property
in event of casualty, the appliances which contribute to the
prevention of casualty at all, are perhaps more so. This is a
gradually increasing and improving element in ships’ outfit.
Conspicuous among this class of articles are navigational
instruments, and of these perhaps the most noteworthy are
the instruments with which the name of Sir William Thomson
is associated, although many others, in use or awaiting adoption,
and designed for equally important purposes, might be
referred to, did space permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Within the period covered by this review, this eminent
inventor has introduced an instrument which enables soundings
to be taken while vessels are going at full speed, at depths
of 100 fathoms and under. The sounding line adopted is a
fine steel wire, such as is used by pianoforte makers, which
passes through the water with very little resistance, and can
be sent to the bottom by a light weight or sinker, even when the
ship is going full speed. Fastened to a short length of rope,
near the sinker, there is a brass tube, in which is placed a
glass tube two feet long, closed at one end and open at the
other. This glass tube is coated inside with chromate of
silver. As the sinker goes down, the air in the tube becomes
compressed, and sea water rises up inside, the height to which
it rises depending on the depth, from the surface, to which
the glass tube goes down. As the sea water rises in the tube,
the salt of the water acts on the chromate of silver and changes
the colour from red to white; thus a mark is left on the glass
tube showing the height to which the sea water rises, from
which the actual depth may be at once measured by a prepared
scale. By means of this sounding machine a ship can feel her
way round a coast in a fog without reducing speed. In later
instruments the inventor has devised another form of automatic
gauge, which obviates the use of glass tubes, and is a
decided improvement on the gauge here described.</p>

<p>The well-known Improved Mariner’s Compass introduced
by Sir W. Thomson enables the magnetism of the ship to be
completely corrected instead of only approximately. This is
attained by the use of several small needles instead of one or
two large ones. The requisite steadiness of the compass card
is obtained by means of an aluminium rim suspended round
the edge of the card. The extreme lightness of the card
reduces greatly the wear of the needle point supporting the
compass. Along with the compass the inventor supplies an
azimuth mirror which greatly facilitates observations either
on a point of land or on a star, the whole invention proving
from experience an almost indispensable item of outfit for
well-appointed vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The care and ingenuity expended on the question of ship
safety must not, however, be measured simply by the amount
of attention and skill exercised in constructing and outfitting
vessels of the common type. The question has very naturally
occasioned many distinct novelties in ship design. Some of
these have been directly designed to secure safety, but the
greater number have aimed at combining with safety the
other qualities of speed and comfort; as in the instances given
in the previous chapter. The success attained in practice, it
need scarcely be said, has hitherto been but partial.</p>

<p>The problem of rendering ships absolutely unsinkable has,
from very early times, received attention from many concerned
in shipbuilding and navigation. Propositions and trials have
been made from time to time, without as yet any very marked
success attending any of them. Various plans have been
submitted for safety-ships, the general principle of which consists
in forming the ship into two or more distinct and entire
portions, and in the event of one sustaining damage by collision
or otherwise, those remaining to be disconnected and sent
adrift—presumably with all passengers on board.</p>

<p>Other life-saving devices, while interfering somewhat
<ins class="corr" id="tn-63" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'with original structure'">
with the original structure</ins>, have simply been intended to use or modify
existing features or material on board ship. Two of these
which have received attention from the Scientific Societies
may be shortly described as examples of the class of devices
referred to. One was the proposition of Mr Jolly, M.A., of
the Royal Navy, laid before the Institution of Naval Architects
in 1874; the other being that of Mr Gadd, submitted to the
Manchester Mechanical Society in 1879. Mr Jolly’s proposal
was to construct what he felicitously termed the “ark saloon,”
an erection on the upper deck, and resembling very closely an
ordinary deck-house, but instead of being built permanently
on the vessel, it was to be an independent structure capable
of being readily disconnected, and “while answering all the
purposes of accommodation found in ordinary deck-houses, to
have within it hidden resources capable of converting it when
afloat into a perfectly navigable vessel.” Mr Gadd’s proposal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
was to form the upper portion of the bulwarks of ships of
loose sections 12-ft. long, composed chiefly of hollow, thin
metallic tubes. These sections when immersed in the water
would form so many pontoons, and would be provided with
cords and loops along their sides, and in the event of the ship
going down would be lifted out of their place by the action of
the water. Objections on economical grounds to Mr Jolly’s
scheme, fully pointed out by members of the Institute, apply
almost equally to the proposal of Mr Gadd. The expense
involved in their application would far outbalance in the eyes
of the shipowner the possible service they could render. No
provision was made by Mr Jolly for launching his ark saloon,
thereby limiting its use to cases of foundering; and even in
event of this, the “ark” was only to be so in name until the
good ship should “go under,” and leave the saloon serenely
floating—presumably with all souls inside. The difficulty in
Mr Gadd’s proposal, of at once making the bulwarks easily
floatable and structurally efficient for the resistance of heavy
seas, seriously detracted from its feasibility.</p>

<p>It would be a somewhat heavy task to make adequate note
of all the varied proposals and patented inventions for the
preservation of life at sea. Some of these, as in the foregoing
instances, are proposals affecting structural features; but
others, and by far the most numerous, are simply adjuncts to
the vessel. Ingenuity has been specially directed of late
towards bringing into efficient requisition, in event of impending
shipwreck, the commonest items of a ship’s outfit. This
has been abundantly evidenced in the several naval exhibitions
held within the past three years in various parts of the
country. Firms whose work lies in cork and Indiarubber
manufactures have there exhibited in great profusion various
forms of life-belts, life-buoys, life-saving mattresses and
pillows, and life-saving dresses. Others, availing themselves
of larger items, have shown life-saving adaptations of deck-seats,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-64" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'deek-houses'">
deck-houses</ins>, and bulwarks made into the form of life-rafts.
Not a few of these devices have received adoption in
our passenger-carrying steamships, and their more general use—especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
if accompanied by proper knowledge of how they
may best be taken advantage of—would materially help to rob
shipwreck of some of its terrors at least, if not of its dire fatalities.
It has been urged in this connection—and the plea is
eminently reasonable—that Parliament should invest the Board
of Trade with proper powers—if that Body is not already vested
with all that is requisite—to take the matter of life-saving
appliances thoroughly and practically in hand, and by means
of experiments in all kinds of weather to determine which are
the best means of saving life under different conditions.
Having done this, also to draw up rules for the proper stowage
and use of such appliances on board ship, and to see that such
rules are strictly observed, and that no vessel be permitted to
go to sea which is not so equipped.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The development in the size of steamships not only affects
the quality of safety, but also in various ways the element of
comfort at sea. The greater length, for instance, is calculated
to neutralise the longitudinal oscillation, the effects of which
are so often fatal to the comfort of passengers. Again, the
great length affords an advantage in the way of allowing
better state-room accommodation; all the rooms, or a larger
proportion of them, being next the vessel’s side, and consequently
more airy and better lighted. It is not, however, in
the increased length so much as in the development of all
three dimensions, and especially in the increased ratio of
breadth to length, that modern types of steamships are
enhanced in the qualities of safety and comfort. Mistaken or
imperfect notions as to the ratio most desirable for speed, have
kept in perpetuity types of steamers which the fuller light of
modern scientific investigation has shown to be undesirable.
Great beam is now believed to be not incompatible with great
speed, and even apart from questions of speed the advantages
accruing from breadth are better appreciated.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this movement, one of the more recent
of the many transatlantic mail steamships may be instanced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
In the <i>Aurania</i>, of the Cunard Company, the proportions—although
perhaps only in the line along which modern professional
ideas tend—are certainly in advance of the general
practice with regard to vessels of her great size. The dimensions
of the <i>Servia</i>, the <i>Alaska</i>, and the <i>City of Rome</i>—three
vessels comparable with the <i>Aurania</i> as constituting the
largest merchant vessels afloat—all give a proportion of 10
beams to the length. The <i>Aurania’s</i> dimensions—470 feet by
57 feet by 39 feet—show her to have only about 8¼ beams to
length. The success of the older type of vessel having proportions
somewhat similar to this “modern instance” has in
no material sense been eclipsed by the narrow types which
subsequently for so long prevailed. Availing themselves of
that freedom which independence of the registration societies
yield—their vessels not being “classed”—the Cunard Coy
determined to adopt the old-time proportions. The step has
been justified, in so far as affected by the matter of speed, the
powerful vessel, at her trials on the Clyde, having attained a
mean speed of 17¾ knots, or 20½ statute miles, per hour. The
stable qualities due to the great breadth of the <i>Aurania</i> has
in actual service further confirmed the wisdom of the change.
The magnificent vessels presently building on the Clyde for
the Cunard Coy., though between 20 and 30 feet longer, are
the same breadth as the <i>Aurania</i>, <em>i.e.</em>, 57 feet. This is
accounted for by the fact that the breadth of beam fixed for
the <i>Aurania</i> was the largest <ins class="corr" id="tn-66" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'amount permissable'">
amount permissible</ins>, having
regard to the breadth of entrance of the largest dock in New
York. This <i lang="fr">en passant</i> is worthy of notice as giving colourable
justification to the complaints sometimes made that civil
engineers are urged to progress in dock accommodation only
by shipbuilders treading on their heels.</p>

<p>Coincident with the changes made in the dimensions and
structure of vessels, there are numerous features of enhanced
comfort for passengers and crew which are deserving of
notice. Notably is this manifest in the arrangement of
saloons and state-rooms—their appointment, lighting, and
ventilation. The character of steamships for the great ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
highways in this respect is above and beyond anything which
Board of Trade enactments seek to secure. The amount of
spirited competition itself on those services, acts as an efficient
promoter of excellence in design and equipment.</p>

<p>It is now the prevailing fashion to appropriate that part of
a steamer just before the engine and boiler hatchways for the
principal saloon and first-class berthing, and it has so many
advantages over the old plan of locating these apartments in
the poop or after extremity of the vessel that its adoption in
large steamers of the passenger-carrying trade has become all
but general. Some of these advantages may be briefly enumerated.
They are:—ampler and airier saloon space: the
plumbness of the vessel’s sides permitting a saloon completely
athwartship, which is scarcely practicable in the conventional
situation aft, because of the curvature of sides; increased
facilities for ventilation; purer air; freedom from the noise and
vibration caused by propeller; comparative immunity from
the effects of “pitching” or longitudinal oscillation.</p>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, in connection with improved saloon
accommodation strikes one so much as the increased height
between decks now prevalent. While from six-and-a-half to
seven-and-a-half feet was considered sufficient some years ago,
it is now the practice in first-class steamers to make the
height as much as from eight-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half
feet. The feeling of spaciousness this change contributes to
the saloons, as well as the scope it yields for architectural
treatment of the walls, are not the least gratifying results of
the improvement. How much the latter result has been taken
advantage of in our modern passenger steamships need scarcely
be told, as their architectural and decorative character is often
and eloquently enlarged upon by delighted voyagers.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF GRAND SALOON IN <i>S.S. America</i>, SHOWING DOME-ROOF.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A noteworthy feature in improved saloon accommodation is
the provision of music rooms or social halls, which are usually
situated above the dining saloons, and connected or made one
therewith by means of light and ventilation wells placed in
the centre. The size and ornamentation of these, and the light
and air they are the means of admitting, contribute in a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
marked degree to the spaciousness,
beauty, and comfort of the
main saloon. By recent
special modifications in
the deck structure, several
builders on the Clyde—notably
Messrs J. &amp; G.

this feature of greater value
than ever. In the National

and height are
augmented in
a remarkable
degree by the
fitting of a
dome-roof extending in
height through two tiers
of decks, and embracing
about half the length of
saloon. This feature—some conception
of which may be gathered
from the sketches shown by Figs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
9 and 10, is altogether free of athwartship beams, and
practically gives to the saloon a clear height of 18 feet. The
crown of the dome is formed of beautifully-executed stained
glass, finished round its base in a richly coloured frieze formed
of panels containing well-executed
oil paintings.
The whole feature, for
structure, ampleness, and
ornamentation, is a noteworthy
advance in the
way of rendering the
saloons of steamships
more comfortable—not to
say palatial—and reflects
the utmost credit on the
building firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Of the multifarious ways in which modern invention and
skill are laid under contribution to the end that voyagers shall
have the maximum of safety and comfort on board ship, the
system of electric lighting now so extensively adopted is not
the least noteworthy. It is only about three years ago since
the application of the incandescent form of electric lamp on
board ship was first tried. The success of the system and its
rapid extension during the subsequent period has been remarkable,
and is a matter upon which electricians, shipowners, and
sea voyagers are alike to be congratulated. In every well-appointed
passenger ship for ocean service, the electric light
has already supplanted the former method of lighting the
saloons, state-rooms, and machinery spaces, by means of oil
lamps, which has so often proved a fruitful source of annoyance
to passengers and crew, if not, indeed, of positive danger
to the vessel herself.</p>

<p>The advantages of the change are such as constitute the
electric light an invaluable acquisition on board every modern
passenger steamship. The light gives off very little heat, there
is no smell, no products of combustion to produce headaches
and sickness. No matches are required, and the danger from
fire is absolutely reduced to a minimum. The light requires
little or no attention on the part of stewards, for it is only
requisite that a man be sent round once a day to see whether
any of the lamps require renewal, and the renewal of a lamp
is performed as simply as trimming the wick of an oil lamp or
placing a fresh candle into a candlestick. The danger, annoyance
and time, formerly spent in storing up and dealing out
large quantities of paraffin or other oils, are completely obviated.
The lamps are as easily subject to the control of the passenger
as ordinary gas jets. Instead of the flickering and somewhat
clumsy oil lamps, the electric system presents, encased in neat,
tiny, glass globes, a steady, mellow white light, the adaptability
of which to any conceivable position or design is one of its most
beautiful properties. The artistic grouping of the electric
incandescent lamps, and their combination with the architectural
features of saloons, are matters to which the forms adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
for the best known lamps—the Edison &amp; Swan types—specially
lend themselves. A single Edison lamp is shown by Fig. 11.</p>

<p>The work in electric lighting on board ship for the year
1883 shows how firmly the electric system has become established
as the only system for first-class passenger vessels. The
report of the Edison &amp; Swan United Companies embraces the
work on thirty-one vessels, including three Indian troopships
(and four more on order), four vessels for the Clan Line, one
for the Peninsular and Oriental Company, one for the Union
Steamship Company, three for the Cunard Company, three for
the British India Steam Navigation Company,
three for the New Zealand Shipping Company,
and so on. The list of Messrs Siemens Brothers
amounts to twenty high-class vessels, including
the <i>Arizona</i>, the <i>Servia</i>, the <i>Aurania</i>, the <i>City
of Rome</i>, the <i>City of Chicago</i>, the <i>Austral</i>, the
<i>Germanic</i>, and the <i>Massilia</i>. These two firms
thus give fifty-one vessels, and adding those
entrusted to outsiders—four in all—affords a
total of fifty-five, representing an aggregate of
not less than 11,000 incandescent lamps.</p>

<p>The application of the electric light on board
ship to the purposes of signalling, as a substitute
for the ordinary system of oil lanterns, has been
fully shown in theory and already partially
effected in practice, but its development in this
direction is necessarily retarded by considerations
which do not affect its use in the interior of vessels.
Vessels traversing the ocean in darkness are necessarily dependent
one on the other for the means of knowing their proximity,
and as the electric light much exceeds in power and brilliancy
that of oil lanterns, it would have the effect of eclipsing the
latter even within a large radius. The adoption of the electric
light for this very important purpose would, therefore, have to
be pretty much a simultaneous and general movement throughout
the ships of the various companies, if not of the various
nations. Apart from such considerations, however, other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
objections have been instanced to the appropriation of the
electric light for this purpose. Difficulty, it is said, has been
experienced in distinguishing the colours pertaining to the
port and starboard side-lights, and fears are entertained regarding
the liability of the light, or the machinery employed in
generating the current, to suddenly fail in its action. Few
of the objections named, of course, amount to very serious
obstacles, and as the system is yet so much in its infancy, it
may well happen that a few years will witness all that is
here foreshadowed.</p>

<p>Short of this universal and complete appropriation of the
electric light for signalling, however, it has been introduced
with gratifying results in mercantile steamers for various
important purposes—<em>e.g.</em>, for lighting up the decks and surrounding
wharfage during the work of loading or disembarking
cargo; for projecting a flood of light ahead of a vessel’s
course where navigation is difficult, and when danger in the
shape of rocks or icebergs is imminent. The employment of
the light in the way last named has been specially extended
in the case of vessels intended for naval warfare. By its
powerful aid the position and tactics of the enemy, the configuration
of forts about to be assailed, or the nature of the land
where it is proposed to disembark, can all be revealed, with
a minuteness almost as perfect as that due to the light of day.</p>

<p>Another feature on board ship affecting most intimately the
well-being and comfort of passengers—too often, indeed, the
safety of the ship itself—is that of ventilation. The thorough
and efficient ventilation of ships is a feature which only during
very recent times has received from shipowners and shipbuilders
the amount of attention it deserves. The inadequacy of the
methods of ventilation existing in emigrant ships, and as applied
to holds for the ventilation of cargoes, engaged public attention
very considerably a few years ago. The explosion on board
the <i>Doterel</i>, with other like casualties, resulted in the appointment
of a Royal Commission to inquire into the ventilation
of ships. The prominence thus given to the subject and the
experience then gained, have been fruitful of increased regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
for efficiency in ship ventilation. In the absence for such a
long time, however, of any system capable of universal application
and having at once the merits of efficiency and cheapness,
shipowners have adhered to old-fashioned, unscientific, and ineffective
methods long after the invention of improved systems,
one or other of which would have well repaid adoption.</p>

<p>In ways and to an extent which may perhaps have been made
evident in the previous pages, the introduction of the electric
light is of itself greatly advantageous in this connection. One
striking peculiarity of the change perhaps requires more explicit
statement. This is the curious fact—patent enough to all who
know anything of the properties of the incandescent light—that
what is the very life of oil or other lights, is to it, certain
death. The element thus vitally concerned is, of course, oxygen;
and it need not be more than hinted that in existing so entirely
without this element—at all times a great desideratum in
passenger ships—the electric light is a vast benefactor to all
who “go down to the sea in ships.”</p>

<p>Many highly-improved methods of ventilation are now open
to the shipowner; the number of patented systems in use or
awaiting adoption being adequate testimony to the widespread
attention bestowed upon the subject. These divide themselves
into two general classes:—firstly, systems which aim at providing
an efficient self-acting series of ventilating pipes in which
the natural current or that induced by the vessel’s own speed
through the atmosphere, is the only force utilised; and secondly,
those in which machines driven by steam power are employed
to produce fresh currents or extract vitiated atmosphere.</p>

  <span class="fs80">FIG. 13.</span>
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="Cross section plan of ventilator">
</figure>

<p>Various forms of ventilators, belonging to the first-named
class, have been introduced into many ocean-going passenger
vessels within recent years, the result being a considerable
improvement in the sanitary condition of the more confined
portions of vessels. One of the most approved of these,
receiving specially extended adoption, amounting as it does to
a highly perfected system, may be noticed a little in detail.
This is the form of ventilator patented and introduced by
Messrs R. Boyle &amp; Son, the well known ventilating engineers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
London and Glasgow, consisting of upcast and downcast shafts
fixed above deck, communicating with the interior of vessel
by a system of piping led to the various compartments. The
upcast, or “air pump” ventilator, as the patentees term it,
consists of a fixed head having an
ingenious arrangement of louvre
webs, whereby the wind impinging
upon it from any direction, creates
a current and exhausts the air from
the cylinder of which the head is
part, the foul air from below immediately
ascending to supply the
place of the air extracted. A continuous
and powerful upward current
is thus induced, and the head
is so devised as to effectually prevent
down-draught or the inlet of water.
The elevation and plan of this ventilator
is shown by Figs. 12 and
13. In Fig. 13, 1 represents
cylindrical chamber communicating
with shaft below; 2, deep lip to prevent
the possibility of water passing
into cylinder and down the shaft;
3, curved plates to deflect and compress
the air over outlet openings or
slits; 4, creates an induced current
and exhausts the air from the
cylinder; 5, radial plates to deflect
air off centre of slits; 6, curved
baffle plate or guard, to concentrate
the current, and prevent the wind
blowing through the slits opposite. The downcast ventilator,
though necessarily more simple, is arranged, by means of similar
louvered webs to prevent any water passing below, lodging it
on the open deck instead. By means of up and downcast ventilators
of this type, it is possible to have the ventilation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
going on between decks without interruption when there is a
storm blowing and seas sweeping the deck, whereas under
ordinary conditions, and in similar weather, everything would
be battened down and the ventilation <em>nil</em>. The inventors, of
course, are able to point to other advantages possessed by
these ventilators, but the above are the salient features, which
have won for their system marked recognition and pretty wide
adoption. As evidencing its efficiency, it may be stated that
Messrs Boyle’s system was awarded the “Burt” prize of £50,
offered for international competition by the Shipwrights’ Coy.
of London in 1882 for the best system of ship ventilation.</p>

<p>Having regard to the great importance of first providing
means whereby foul air may be extracted from compartments
rather than first attempting to put fresh air in—at least by
other than mechanical means—it has become the practice with
several steamship companies to fit a series of pipes from the
rooms throughout the ’tween decks all leading into a common
main, carrying this main into the boiler funnel, and thus
utilising the powerful draught existing there when the vessel
is under way. The efficiency of this method is all that could
be wished, but its action is necessarily impaired when the
vessel is in port and the boilers not in use. For steamships
having long runs its value is very considerable; but in steamers
having short passages and long port delays its merits are not so
pronounced, and it is, of course, of no account when sailing
ships are concerned.</p>

<p>Two systems of ventilation much alike in principle and
equally applicable to the steamer and sailing ship may be
shortly referred to. One is the Norton Ventilator, in which
the dipping motion of vessels is utilised in effecting their own
ventilation; the action in ocean-going vessels, of course, being
continuous and automatic. Two cylinders, closed at the upper
ends, are placed on each side of the stern post at such a distance
as not to interfere in any way with the action of the rudder,
and sufficiently close under the stern to be well out of harm’s
way. As the vessel rises the water drops in these cylinders,
which are partly submerged, and in its fall causes a vacuum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
to fill which the air is drawn from all parts of the ship. The
sinking motion of the vessel again fills the cylinders and forces
the foul air collected, through the discharge pipes. The ventilator
admits also of being actuated by steam or other power
on board steamships, the exhausting and forcing device in this
case consisting of a water bell or air chamber to which a vertical
reciprocating motion is imparted by a beam or other attachment
operated upon by the mechanical power adopted. The
other method referred to is that now being pretty extensively
introduced by Messrs Mosses and Mitchell, of London. It
consists of two small cylinders, placed on either side of a ship,
in-board, and connected by a pipe. The cylinders are partly
filled with water, and, as the vessel rolls, the water rushes from
the elevated to the depressed side of the ship, from one
cylinder to the other, and, by creating a vacuum, draws up
the foul air from between decks, or out of the hold, by pipes
leading below. The air which is pumped up by this self-acting
process goes out through a discharge pipe over the side,
and such is the force of its exit that it serves to blow a foghorn
when required. The cylinders can be placed so as to be
worked by the pitching as well as the rolling of the vessel,
and there is always a sufficient movement of the water to
keep these pumps in action.</p>

<p>Systems of the other class—those involving the aid of
mechanical power—are as much available as the automatic
systems, but the greater expense of fitting, maintaining, and
working them are considerations, apart from the question of
their greater efficiency, which stand in the way of their general
adoption. In vessels chiefly intended for passenger or emigrant
carrying, artificial ventilation by mechanical means has been
provided, and the practice is greatly on the increase, but systems
in which natural agents are more largely brought into requisition
have advantages which appeal most effectually to ship
owners in general.</p>

<p>In several modern steamships engaged in cargo and passenger
service, hydraulic machinery designed to take the place
of the usual deck steam equipment has recently been introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
with great advantage. This embraces machinery used
for steering the vessel, loading and discharging cargo, heaving
anchors; for performing, indeed, all the work on board excepting
that of propulsion. From experience of the well proved utility
and durability of hydraulic power on shore, it seems quite a
natural consequence that it should take its place on board
ship. Indeed, the system has so many advantages both from
the point of view of the passenger and of the steamship owner,
the wonder is that its introduction has been so long delayed.
Its perfect noiselessness, as compared with the rattling, hissing,
steam machinery now in vogue, is an advantage which will
appeal strongly to the sea voyager. The great speed of the
system, as well as the absence of jar and noise, the reduction
in wear and tear, and the obviating of well-known disadvantages
incidental to steam pipes, are merits of the system which
are bound to appeal to the steamship owner.</p>

<p>It has been well pointed out by Mr A. Betts Brown, of
Edinburgh, the patentee and manufacturer of this class of
machinery, in a paper read by him before a recent meeting of
the Institution of Naval Architects that—“With all the noise
of steam engines at work on deck, running at piston speeds of
as much as 1000 feet per minute, the cargo is lifted from the
hold at a rate of only from one to two feet per second, which
cannot be considered as keeping pace with the general progress
made in other departments of steamship economy. In short,
vast sums are spent on fuel to gain half a knot extra speed on
a passage, while hours may be wasted in port in consequence
of the primitive nature of the present system of deck machinery
for discharging cargo.” Previous to 1880, Mr Brown had supplied
and fitted hydraulic machinery on board the paddle-steamer
<i>Cosmos</i>, built by Messrs A. &amp; J. Inglis, of Glasgow,
intended for South American river service, but it was only in
that year that he had an opportunity of fitting a large ocean-trading
steamship with the system. This was the <i>Quetta</i>, built
by Messrs Denny, Dumbarton, to whom, with the managers of
the British India Association Steam Navigation Company, who
own the vessel, Mr Brown ascribes credit for the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
afforded him of fitting his firm’s system on a complete scale.
The <i>Quetta</i> is 380-ft. in length, 40-ft. breadth, depth of hold
29-ft., and 3,302 tons gross, and is fitted with a complete system
of hydraulic machinery performing the following functions:—Steering,
heaving the anchor, warping by capstans fore and aft,
taking in and discharging cargo, lowering the derricks to clear
cargo over side, hoisting ashes, reversing main engines, and
shutting tunnel water-tight door in engine-room. For detailed
descriptions of these various appliances, the reader is referred
to the before-mentioned paper. The most for which space is here
available is a very general outline of the principle on which
they are supplied with motive power. The prime mover consists
of a pair of compound surface-condensing pumping engines
of 100 indicated horse-power, situated in the engine-room of
the vessel. These engines pump water (or in winter non-freezing
fluid) from a tank into a steam accumulator. The
pumping engines are started and stopped by the falling or
rising of the steam piston in the accumulator; and since the
piston falls when the hydraulic power is being utilised, and
rises to its former level when the power is not in use, it follows
that the apparatus is perfectly automatic. Once started, it
does not require the supervision of an engineer, and it maintains
a steady pressure of 800-lbs. per square inch in the
hydraulic mains or pressure pipes. These are carried up from
the engine-room, and extend fore and aft the ship. Alongside
the pressure main a similar return main is laid, which
discharges into the tank. From the pressure mains branches
are connected to the various hydraulic machines. After having
done its work, the water is discharged into the return mains,
being thus used over and over again. The experience obtained
in the working of the <i>Quetta</i> shows that a donkey boiler of
the usual size, just sufficient for steam winches, enables the
cargo to be discharged in half the time: in other words, does
double the work on a given coal consumpt with compound surface-condensing
pumping engine, and the hydraulic system.</p>

<p>The advantages of hydraulic machinery have been thus
summarised:—A pair of engines in one place do, with no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
noise and half the consumption of fuel, the work usually
performed by perhaps a dozen donkey engines, while about
£30 or £40 a voyage is saved in wear and tear. The
increase of speed obtained in loading and discharging cargo
practically ensures a quicker voyage. The rapidly working
machinery necessitates double gangs of men in the hold; but
though the hands are more numerous they are paid for a
shorter time, and the cost of labour per ton of cargo is thus
less than usual. The prime outlay is considerably greater
than under the ordinary system, but it is calculated that in at
least three years the extra expense will have been saved.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the considerable increase in cost (more than
double that of steam equipment) of the hydraulic system, the
British India Association have seen their way to fit the succeeding
steamers they have built, similarly to the <i>Quetta</i>,
namely, the <i>Bulimba</i>, <i>Waroonga</i>, and <i>Manora</i>, the two intervening
ships having their emigrant quarters ventilated by fans
driven by hydraulic engines, as well as the usual deck equipment.
In addition to the above, there have already been nine
other steamers fitted successfully by Mr Brown’s firm with
hydraulic machinery—including the Union Steamship Coy.’s
<i>Tartar</i>, of 4340 tons—and there is every prospect now of its
taking the place of the noisy steam machinery in at least
our most important passenger lines.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The regard which is had to comfort and luxury in modern
passenger steamers has manifested itself—like the attention
devoted to swiftness and safety—in various propositions and
designs of a more or less novel kind. These, indeed, have very
often consisted of designs embracing the whole of the qualities
named; comfort and luxury being coincident with the more
important properties of speed and safety already noticed; but
not a few propositions and actual undertakings have consisted
of vessels in which comfort has largely been the dominant and
regulating condition of design. This subject receives happier
illustration from the history of steam service between England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and France, than perhaps from any other service that could
be instanced. The thought and speech expended on “an
efficient Channel service” at the meetings of the various
societies concerned with shipbuilding and marine engineering,
and the space devoted to the subject in the technical journals,
has been no more than commensurate with the number and
variety of projects for its accomplishment, submitted from time
to time. Many of the schemes have not been quite of a
marine character, and these, of course, lie beyond the province
of the present review; but so far as ships are concerned, it is
interesting to note to what extent comfort has been the dominant
and regulating condition in the designs. In the <i>Castalia</i>
and the <i>Calais-Douvres</i>, employed in Channel service, features
of considerable novelty—notably the double hulls—were
adopted, and it was to the desire for increased comfort as
much as speed that their introduction was owing.</p>

<p>In the steamer <i>Bessemer</i>, however, built at Hull in 1875,
this subject finds happiest illustration. This steamer, which
involved some very interesting and novel problems in shipbuilding—in
which the matters of propulsion and steering
were largely concerned—was designed for the special purpose
of practically testing an invention of Mr Henry Bessemer’s,
having as its object the alleviation of the evils of sea-sickness.
Mr (now Sir Henry) Bessemer’s invention, as applied in this
case, consisted of a saloon supported on longitudinal pivots,
which was to be made unsusceptible to transverse oscillation
by the application to it of machinery wrought by hydraulic
power. It was the intention of the eminent inventor to have
applied this system to the correction of longitudinal as well as
transverse oscillation, but on considering that the steamer was
to be of large dimensions and performing a service in comparatively
small waves it was thought desirable to limit its
application to transverse motion, at the same time having
regard to the longitudinal motion by reducing the height of
the vessel for a distance of 50-ft. at each end, thereby inducing
depression at the extremities, through the vessel’s not rising
to, but being overswept by, the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Although an influential company was formed to work the
<i>Bessemer</i> and other vessels embodying her novel features,
which it was thought might follow, she was virtually abandoned
after <ins class="err" id="err-81" title="Erratum: was 'a single trial'">one or two trials</ins> across the Channel. Her failure was assumed
without exhaustive and conclusive trials being made of the
many novelties embodied in her construction, some of which
were obviously of an experimental character. This is the more
to be regretted because of the beneficent issues involved in
the project, and also in some degree because of the extent to
which the faith of some intrepid and experienced men was
pledged to its success. Nevertheless, it was always a matter
of grave doubt, even when the fullest measure of mechanical
success was allowed for, whether the idea of the pivoted saloon
was calculated to secure that immunity from the effects of ship
motion in a seaway, for which the celebrated patentee felt
induced to hope.</p>

<p>It is maintained by many who profess to have given the
subject attention, that sea-sickness in its most virulent forms,
and in the majority of instances, is less attributable to the
transverse and longitudinal oscillations—known respectively,
as the “rolling” and “pitching” motions—than to the vertical
movement termed “dipping,” which in its descent from the
summit of one wave until upborne by the wave next following,
the vessel undergoes. Now, this is a condition for which, in
the Bessemer project, there was no provision, nor indeed well
can be under any circumstances, save in the simple but costly
expedient of adding to the dimensions or bulk of vessels, irrespective
of form. The Czar of Russia’s yacht <i>Livadia</i>, built
some years ago, exemplified in her extraordinary dimensions
and great bulk the truth of such reasoning. The actual rolling
and pitching of this remarkable vessel, as observed in the
height of a gale in the Bay of Biscay, and in the midst of very
heavy seas, was exceeding small. This never exceeded four
degrees for the single roll, or seven degrees for the double roll,
nor beyond five degrees for the forward pitch, or nine degrees
for the double pitch, so to speak. This horizontal steadiness
appeared to experts, who were on board at the time, most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
remarkable, and Sir E. J. Reed, in a communication to the
<cite>Times</cite>, commented amongst other things on the agreeableness
of the contrast the voyage on the <i>Livadia</i> afforded, with his
experience of voyaging at sea in ordinary ships.</p>

<p>After all, it must be acknowledged that attempts hitherto
made to obviate the evils of sea-sickness by novelty in design
fall very far short of attaining the beneficent results sought
after. The <i>Bessemer</i>, the <i>Livadia</i>, the <i>Calais-Douvres</i>, and other
<em>unique</em> craft primarily conceived with regard to this end, are
now, it would seem, exemplifying in their latter fate the futility
of the endeavour. Such attempts, however ill-advised they
may possibly appear in the light of the knowledge their very
failure or their partial successes yield, have still their creditable
and praiseworthy aspects. The spirit which has prompted
some of them is not wholly one of money-making, and their
histories enrich the general fund of experience far more than
libraries of untried theories. Shipowners are too ready to shut
their minds against everything which seeks the <em>acme</em> of comfort
and safety by other means than those which guarantee
<em>economical</em> success, or those which consist in increasing the
size and power, and enhancing the accommodation of conventional
types of vessels. These novelties and innovations, on
the other hand, represent more of the intrepidity essential to
genuine advancement than is forthcoming in a thousand merchant
ships of the conventional type.</p>

<p>Happily the need for such enterprise as is involved in at
once departing from tried types, has within recent years been
largely, if not altogether, obviated, through improved procedure
in the work of design. The more thoroughly analytic process
of investigation and experiment now in vogue, greatly curtails
the number of novelties introduced, or which reach the constructive
stage. Many present-day projects never get beyond
the “paper stage,” which in times not so far distant would
have spelled out “failure” to the very last letter. Since the
system of model experiment has begun to be practised in a
reliable manner, and since theoretical prediction generally has
become better appreciated, over-sanguine inventors have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
spared the penalties of failure in actual practice, and ingenuity
has been reclaimed or warned away from channels that would
inevitably have proved chimerical.</p>

<span class="fs80">PROGRESS IN THE SCIENCE OF SHIPBUILDING.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The appreciation and employment of scientific method and
analysis in designing and building ships have at no previous
time been greater than they are at present. This is already
yielding benefits and ensuring successes which only a few years
ago would have remained ungathered and unachieved, or at best
would only have been attained after wasteful expenditure of
money, time, and skill, if not the sacrifice of human life. Not
so long ago endeavours were seldom made to extract lessons of
general value from particular occurrences, there being a disposition
prevalent to accept facts without accounting for them—“to
rejoice in a success and regard a failure as irreparable”—the
outcome, it may at once be said, of indifference, false ideas
of economy, and of a limited conception of the part scientific
methods should play in successful shipbuilding.</p>

<p>Particular occurrences within recent years have without
doubt played a large part in bringing about this more general
and intelligent appreciation of such matters. Some maintain,
indeed, that it is only under pressure of circumstances that
anything like proper regard for fundamental principles has
obtained hold among mercantile shipbuilders. This remissness,
even admitting it to be true, is the more natural and excusable
in private commercial concerns, when it is considered that the
bulk of progress made, even in Admiralty quarters—where
ships take several years each to build, and there is more time
for scientific investigation and experiment than is possible in
mercantile work—is more attributable to the awakenings which
have followed upon great disasters than to the natural improvement
of ordinary practice. The terrible loss of the <i>Captain</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
September, 1870, for example, by which 500 lives were sacrificed,
led to a fuller recognition of the necessity for exact
experiment and calculation to determine thoroughly the conditions
of stability for war vessels; and many war-ships then
under construction at the dockyards—particularly those of
the low freeboard type—were altered in consequence, for the
purpose of adding to their safety. The capsizing of the <i>Eurydice</i>
off the Isle of Wight in March, 1878; the mysterious and
mournful loss of her sister ship the <i>Atalanta</i> in 1880; the
explosion on board the <i>Thunderer</i> in 1876, by which 45
lives were lost, and the still more calamitous case of the
<i>Doterel</i> in April, 1881, by which the ship and 148 lives were
destroyed, are all instances of calamity, the causes of which
have formed the subject of official inquiry, all in their turn
teaching important lessons and yielding subsequent benefits
not easily calculable.</p>

<p>Recent occurrences of a very calamitous nature in connection
with merchant ships—some of which will be more explicitly
referred to further on—have been attended with similarly
mournful, but, it may be added, with similarly beneficial results.
These disasters and the resulting inquiries have shown pretty
conclusively that the knowledge of a vessel’s stability and
other vital qualities possessed by ship’s officers is often meagre
and erroneous; and that far too little attention is usually paid
to a vessel’s technical qualities by shipowners or their advisers.
They have also tended to prove that exact knowledge of the
principles of ship design, and observance of scientific method
in their construction, are not yet sufficiently prevalent or
thorough in mercantile shipyards.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Progress in the pure science of naval architecture, as distinguished
from the practical application of scientific rules and
principles to shipbuilding, is a great and complex subject, and
one which it would be impossible to do full justice to here.
Before attempting to treat upon these matters as concerned
with the period covered by this review, it may be instructive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
to trace briefly the progress made in the past, and take note
of the agencies through which such progress has been effected.
In this undertaking, concerned as it is with matters relating
to a period prior to that with which the present work chiefly
deals, the author has availed himself to some extent of already
published works traversing the same ground. As having
afforded the needful assistance in this connection, and as being
a source to which readers may turn for fuller information,
reference may here be made to an article in the <i>Westminster
Review</i> of January, 1881, on “The Progress of Shipbuilding in
England.” This article, though unsigned, is from the pen of
Mr W. H. White, late Chief Constructor of the Navy, and
author of the well known “Manual of Naval Architecture.”
It furnishes an appreciative and concise account of the literature
and the educational agencies connected with the theory
of naval architecture, and sketches the influence of science on
practice, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i> in the profession since the beginning
of the present century.</p>

<p>As has already been indicated, the period during which
scientific knowledge and methods have had any considerable
place in merchant shipbuilding, does not extend back over very
many years. In connection with the Royal Navy, however,
the study of scientific naval architecture has been fostered and
promoted under Government auspices almost from the commencement
of the present century; not, however—it must be
added—without alternating periods of regard and neglect, nor
irrespective of pressure from extraneous sources.</p>

<p>Although progress in this matter has not been solely due to
Government agencies, it may be maintained that a large part
of the positive and accurate scientific knowledge which now
exists has grown out of the exigencies of the naval service,
and has come from sources more or less supported by or connected
with Government institutions. It will of course be
understood that the science of naval architecture is a field in
which many besides shipbuilders, and indeed many besides
professional naval architects, have laboured with signal success.
The fund of knowledge has been enriched, and the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
shipbuilding improved, by men whose association with the
shipyard has been of an indirect and amateur kind, and—it
must be added—whose valuable labours the shipyard has often
but scantily recognised. Mathematicians—“mere theorists,”
as they have been called—have made original investigations
and scientific analyses which have upset many previously
received practical notions, and established principles, the appreciation
of which alone, has led to subsequent progress in actual
practice. The part taken by merchant shipbuilders has consisted
in the experimental verification, and sometimes the
practical correction of principles thus evolved, but even to
this extent the service done has been largely incidental. Those
considerations which form the economic basis of every commercial
concern have naturally circumscribed such service, and
only a few notable firms have been able to break through
the common restrictions.</p>

<p>The systematic study of scientific naval architecture may
be said only to have begun in Britain in 1811, in which year,
as the outcome of recommendations made by a Government
Commission appointed to inquire into naval construction in
1806, the first School of Naval Architecture was established at
Portsmouth, under the direction of Dr Inman, a distinguished
member of the University of Cambridge. All the great
advances which had been made previously in the science of
naval architecture were chiefly due to foreigners, and any one
wishing to acquaint himself at first hand with all that was
then most advanced would have to consult the learned treatises
of such distinguished Frenchmen as Bouguer, Dupin, Euler,
D’Alembert, and the Abbé Bossut, of the distinguished
Spaniard Don Juan d’Ulloa, and of Chapman, the celebrated
constructor of the Swedish Navy. One or two English writers,
between 1750 and 1800, had published translations of some of
these foreign treatises, but the only original work of any importance
was by Atwood, who contributed a “Disquisition on the
Stability of Ships” to the proceedings of the Royal Society
(1796-98). This contribution was both a criticism and an
extension of flotation and stability investigations by Bouguer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and as an example of scientific method applied to exact calculations
of the qualities of ships it is still well worthy of
study. In 1791 a “Society for the Improvement of Naval
Architecture” had been formed, the membership being both
numerous and influential, and in 1806 the growing sense of need
for improved scientific methods culminated in the appointment
of the Commission above mentioned, and in the establishment
five years later of the first School of Naval Architecture. This
institution existed for over twenty years, over forty students
were trained, and the science of naval architecture was greatly
promoted through its agency. Almost as a body the students
of this school, with their able teacher, deserve the honour of
being regarded as the founders of an English literature of naval
architecture. Nevertheless, the recognition of Dr Inman’s
services, and his pupils’ capabilities as designers, by the naval
authorities was of a cold and disappointing nature. Ultimately,
however, many of them attained positions wherein their talents
found worthy exercise.</p>

<p>After the abolition of the School of Naval Architecture, under
Dr Inman, in 1832, no agency for higher education existed
until 1848, when the urgent necessity for a steam re-construction
of the Navy forced attention to the want of trained
men, and resulted in the establishment of a second school at
Portsmouth. The principal of this school was Dr Woolley, an
eminent graduate of the University of Cambridge. From 1848
on to the present time, Dr Woolley has held a prominent place
amongst the promoters of naval science, and the pupils produced
by the institution under his directorship have given
in various ways good practical evidence of his capability as
a teacher. After five or six years of useful work, this second
school was done away with, and a third was established in
London in 1864, after pressure had been brought to bear upon
the Government of the day by the Institution of Naval Architects—an
association which was founded in 1860, and which
has since had so flourishing an existence.</p>

<p>The new school was placed for a time under the control of
the Science and Art Department at South Kensington, Dr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Woolley being Inspector-General, and the late Mr C. W. Merrifield,
F.R.S., Principal. This school, unlike its predecessors,
was not nominally a mere Admiralty establishment, but offered
admission to private naval architects and engineers, and did
not exclude foreigners. It remained in operation at South Kensington
until 1873, when the Admiralty decided to establish
the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and to train their
students of naval architecture and marine engineering there.
Since 1873, therefore, what may be regarded as a continuation
of the third school has been at work at Greenwich, the Admiralty
granting facilities for the entry of private and foreign
students, much as was done at South Kensington.</p>

<p>The small extent to which this institution has been taken
advantage of by private students, or by those whose aim is
to equip themselves for service in merchant shipbuilding,
notwithstanding the inducements existing in the shape of
substantial scholarships, has often been subject of comment.
Various reasons have been adduced for this state of matters,
but the true cause would seem to be largely concerned with
the character of the entrance examinations and with the
course of study provided. The subject is well worthy of
consideration, and fuller reference will be made to it further
on when some educational agencies which have been recently
established are under consideration.</p>

<p>At such important junctures in the history of shipbuilding
as the introduction of steam power for propulsion in place of
sails, and the employment of iron in place of wood for the
hulls, precedent and experience lost much of their value under
the new conditions. The association of civil and mechanical
engineers with shipbuilding at these crises was of immense
advantage. Such men as Fairbairn and Brunel, who had
previously gained high reputations in other branches, were
enabled by their scientific skill in designing bridges and other
structures in wrought-iron, to achieve much, and to take the
lead in ship design and construction. “To men of this class,”
says Mr W. H. White, in the article already alluded to,
“careful preliminary investigation and calculation naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
formed part of the work of designing ships; ‘rule of thumb’
was not likely to find favour, even if it had been applicable,
which it was not, under the circumstances. At first, much
was done on imperfect methods, comparatively in the dark;
failures were not rare; yet progress was made, and gradually
greater precision was attained, in the attempt to design steamers
capable of proceeding at certain assigned speeds when laden to
a given draught. In fact, the construction of steamers rendered
imperative a careful study of the laws of fluid resistance, and
of the cognate investigation of the mechanical theory of propulsion—both
of which subjects lay practically outside the field of
the designers of sailing ships. The speed of a sailing ship is
obviously dependent upon the force and direction of the wind;
her designer, therefore, chooses forms and proportions which
will enable a good spread of canvas to be carried, on a handy
stable vessel. Questions of resistance to the progress of the
ship were therefore subordinated to sail-carrying power and
handiness in sailing ships; whereas in steamers designed for a
certain speed the question of resistance occupies a primary
place, seeing that the engine power must be proportioned to
the resistance. Consequently, while keeping in view stability,
handiness, and structural strength, the designer of a steamer
has a more difficult task than the designer of a sailing ship,
and the difficulty can only be met if faced intelligently by
scientific analysis. Hence it happened, as was previously
remarked, that a more general appreciation of the value of
scientific methods accompanied the development of steam navigation
and iron shipbuilding in the British mercantile marine.”</p>

<p>Another name that must be linked with those already mentioned
in connection with the change from wood to iron in
shipbuilding, and with the new conditions imposed by the
transition from sail to steam, is that of the late Mr John
Scott Russell, already referred to at the beginning of this
work. In the fields of inquiry so largely opened up at the
period referred to, Mr Russell was a most distinguished
worker. His advocacy and adoption in practice of special
structural principles, as illustrated not only in the <i>Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Eastern</i> but in other vessels, has influenced subsequent practice
incalculably, and by his persevering investigations upon the
resistance of vessels, and the “wave-line” theory he advanced,
as well as by his inquiry into the characteristics of wave motion,
he laid designers of that period and subsequent investigators
under great indebtedness. His contributions to the
literature of the profession—notably his <i lang="la">magnum opus</i>, entitled
“Modern System of Naval Architecture”—and the large share
he subsequently took in the deliberations of the Institution
of Naval Architects, and of other societies concerned with
shipbuilding and engineering, enhance that indebtedness and
remain as permanent records of his skill and originality.</p>

<p>Approaching the period with which this review is more particularly
concerned, reference must now be made to the valuable
labours of two eminent men, whose loss the profession has had
to mourn within recent years. These are the late Professor
Macquorn Rankine and the late Mr William Froude, neither
of whom was by profession a naval architect, yet both of whom
were led by love of the subject to give their matured experience
as civil engineers and mathematical experts to the promotion
of knowledge in this domain.</p>

<p>Rankine appears to have become specially interested in
the problems connected with ship design, after he became
Professor of Civil Engineering at Glasgow University in 1855.
Conjointly with Mr Isaac Watts, late Chief Constructor of
the Navy, and formerly a student of the first School of Naval
Architecture; Mr F. K. Barnes, now Surveyor of Dockyards,
and Chief Constructor of the Navy, and a distinguished
student of the second school; and the late Mr J. R. Napier, a
member of the famous Clyde shipbuilding firm, Prof. Rankine
produced in 1866 “Shipbuilding: Theoretical and Practical.”
This valuable treatise was edited, and for the most part written,
by Prof. Rankine, and provides a complete system of information
on all branches of shipbuilding and marine engineering,
although subsequent progress in certain departments of naval
science has made a new edition desirable. The work is also
distinguished for its enunciation of several theories connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
with the resistance and propulsion of vessels by Prof. Rankine,
which have become the accepted basis of modern practice. Of
these the mechanical theory of the action of propellers, and the
stream-line theory of resistance, are the best known. His
investigations and writings on the latter subject were most
ably supplemented and confirmed by Mr Froude, whose beautifully-contrived
model experiments, coupled with his discovery
of the law by which such experiments can be made to afford
reliable data for the resistance of full-sized vessels, have laid
the profession under even a heavier load of indebtedness.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the only work of investigation and
experiment with which Mr Froude actively and inseparably
identified himself. Taking up a subject which many authorities
before him had studied and written upon with but little success—that
of the phenomena of wave motion and the oscillation of
ships in a seaway—he propounded and demonstrated at the
Institution of Naval Architects in 1861, after much careful
thought and experiment, a theory with respect to it which at
that time was entirely new and striking, but which has since
been firmly established as the sound one.</p>

<p>At first, authorities in the science of naval architecture, like
Moseley and Dr Woolley, regarded the new theory with suspicion
and disapproval; Rankine, on the contrary, warmly
supported it, and helped to develop it and to answer various
objections urged against the hypothesis on which it was based.
For nearly twenty years Mr Froude steadily pursued the
inquiry, adding one mathematical investigation to another,
carrying out numerous experiments, and making voyages for
the purpose of studying the behaviour of ships. Broadly
speaking, it may be said that whereas earlier investigations
gave to the naval architect the power of making estimates of
the buoyancy and stability of ships floating in smooth water,
they gave up as altogether hopeless the attempt to predict the
behaviour of ships at sea, or to determine the causes which
produce heavy rolling. On the other hand, thanks to Mr
Froude, the designer of a ship now knows what precautions to
take in order to promote steadiness and good behaviour at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Although the propositions enunciated by Mr Froude were
accepted as laws in a wonderfully short time—considering
their startling nature—their influence on practice, and especially
the practical application of the methods of comparison
by which they had been established, have not even yet been
brought to anything like their full issue. The work is being
continued upon the lines laid down by Mr Froude, amongst
others by men whose closer intimacy with the actual affairs
of the shipbuilding yard may be expected to yield results which
will be more immediately reflected in actual practice.</p>

<p>Passing allusion has already been made to the founding of
the Institution of Naval Architects, but an association which
has gathered into its membership so largely of all sections of
men concerned with shipbuilding and shipping, and absorbs
so much of the knowledge and talent in these domains, must
have fuller reference made to it. Regarding its foundation, in
1860, Mr White, in his article in the <cite>Westminster Review</cite>, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The scheme of the Institution was happily conceived and well executed.
Amongst its earliest members were found the trained naval architects of the
first and second Schools, the leading private shipbuilders and marine engineers,
the principal shipbuilding officers of the Dockyards, men of science specially
interested in naval architecture, shipowners, merchants, and others connected
with shipping; while a considerable number of sailors from the Royal Navy and
Mercantile Marine showed their appreciation of the value of naval science by
becoming Associates. The list of names is eminently representative. Sir John
Pakington (afterwards Lord Hampton), then only recently retired from the
office of First Lord of the Admiralty, was the first President. Many experienced
naval officers supported him. There were men like Watts, Read, and Moorsom,
who had been pupils of Dr Inman half a century before; others, like Fairbairn,
Laird, and Grantham, who had been conversant with iron shipbuilding from
its commencement; marine engineering was worthily represented by veterans
like Penn, Maudslay, and Lloyd; mathematicians and men of science like
Canon Moseley, Dr Woolley, Professor Airy, and Mr Froude appear on the
list. Private shipbuilders and naval architects like Scott Russell, Samuda,
Napier, and White, joined in the movement, so did the surveying staff of Lloyd’s
Register. In fact, there was a general appreciation of the endeavour to establish
an association which should enable all classes interested in shipping to interchange
ideas and experience with a view to general improvement. Mr Reed
was the first Secretary, retaining that post until he was appointed Chief Constructor
of the Navy, and in that position did much to aid the progress of the
Institution.”</p>
</div>

<p>While it is true that the membership list of the Institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
in its early days was of the representative character above
indicated, it should be pointed out that the actual proceedings
of the Institution were not shared in by anything like the
variety of talent which the list comprised, or which now distinguishes
its annual meetings. For many years it was almost
the exclusive conference of Admiralty authorities and members
of those shipbuilding and engineering firms who undertook
Government work, and the transactions for a long time were
very largely confined to purely naval matters. The scientific
value of the earlier volumes of the transactions would certainly
have suffered considerably if the papers by Mr Froude and
Prof. Rankine had not formed contributions, and the prosperity
and development of the Institution would have been equally
lessened had there not been general infusion of “new blood”
from the mercantile marine in all parts of the country. This
has been going on during the past twelve years or more, and
the scope and utility of the Institution’s proceedings have
increased with the change. Of the later development of the
Institution, the authority already quoted says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Owing to the rapid advances constantly being made in both the science
and the practice of the profession, the ‘Transactions’ have come to be the
chief text-books available. Members and Associates have joined from all the
great maritime nations. Members of the professional corps of naval architects
and engineers of France, Austria, Italy, Germany, the United States,
Russia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, are proud to be numbered with
their English professional brethren, and not a few of these foreign members
have contributed valuable Papers. The meetings of the Institution afford
exceptional opportunities for the discussion of questions having general interest,
as well as others having more special value to professional men. Different
views of the same subject find capable exponents, and lead to valuable discussions.
The latest systems of construction and most recent changes in
<em>materiel</em> are described by competent authorities. Valuable <em>data</em> are put on
record relating to the designs and performances of war-ships and merchant-ships.
Inventions of various kinds are described and examined. Abstruse
theoretical investigations are by no means rare; and, in many cases, the contribution
of one such Paper by an original thinker has given a start to others
and led to important extensions of knowledge. In fact, the Institution of
Naval Architects has admirably fulfilled the intentions of its founders, acting
as a centre where valuable information could be collected, and whence it could
be distributed for the general benefit of the profession. Before it was founded
naval science had no home in England; its treasures lay scattered far and wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
in occasional Memoirs and Papers; but now everything worth preservation
naturally finds its way to the ‘Transactions.’ Any movement affecting shipping
also leaves its record there in Papers and Discussions which will hereafter have
a high historical value.”</p>
</div>

<p>As evidencing the change which has latterly come over the
Institution with respect to its annual proceedings, it may be
noted that whereas in the early years there were at some
meetings no papers—leaving out of account those by Froude
and Rankine—except by Admiralty members and others concerned
with Government work, there was not a single paper
by an Admiralty man during the meetings of the present year.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the general reference already made to Mr Froude’s
invaluable labours in connection with the resistance of vessels
the brief statement of the agencies through which progress has
been made during the present century may be considered as
brought down to the period coming within the scope of the
term “Modern,” as used in this work. The more difficult
task of chronicling the progress made during the period in
question, both in the science of naval architecture purely,
and in the application of science to practice, must now be
attempted. The plan upon which it is proposed to accomplish
this is to show wherein and to what extent scientific methods
in designing and observing the behaviour of ships have been
regarded, and indicating generally where still further improvement
may be looked for. To accomplish this in such a way as to
take appreciative account of the most salient features, and yet
to avoid difficult technical terms and unnecessary elaboration,
may involve some omissions and slight inaccuracies, important
enough from a strictly scientific point of view, yet which do
not materially affect the faithfulness of the record.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>As preparing the way for references to those more special
points in connection with which scientific progress has taken
place during recent years, the following general and elementary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
outlines of the principal scientific problems in ship
design and construction may be helpful to many readers:—</p>


<h3>DISPLACEMENT AND CARRYING CAPABILITY.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A vessel floating at rest displaces a volume of water whose weight
equals her own total weight.</p>

<p>For vessels floating in sea water the number of cubic feet of water
displaced per ton of weight is, as nearly as possible, thirty-five. For
vessels in fresh water—<em>i.e.</em>, lakes or rivers—the cubic feet per ton
of weight is thirty-six.</p>

<p>By calculating the volume of under-water portion of the vessel’s
hull, the number of cubic feet displaced by the vessel when floating
at any given draught is obtained. This result, divided by 35 or 36,
according as the water is salt or fresh, gives the number of tons
weight displaced, and consequently the total weight of the vessel.</p>

<p>Calculations being made of the volume of the vessel’s hull to
intermediate distances between the keel and the maximum load line,
it is thus possible to construct a “curve of displacement” from
which the actual amount of displacement at any intermediate
draught can be obtained.</p>

<p>From this curve a set of scales—usually set up alongside a vertical
scale of feet and inches, representing the vessel’s draught-marks—are
constructed, showing—1st, the tons “displacement” at any
draught; 2nd, the tons of “dead-weight” capability—<em>i.e.</em>, the tons
displacement due to the weight of cargo, coal, ballast, stores, fresh
water, spare gear, &amp;c.—at any draught above the vessel’s light-draught: 
“light-draught” being that at which the vessel floats with
holds clean-swept, bilges dry, water in boilers, and with such spare
gear on board as is required by Board of Trade; and 3rd, the amount
of “freeboard”—<em>i.e.</em>, the distance in feet and inches from any particular
draught line to the top of the deck amidships.</p>
</div>


<h3>BUOYANCY AND STABILITY.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A ship floating upright and at rest in still water must fulfil two
conditions—1st, as stated above, she must displace, a weight of
water equal to her own weight; 2nd, her centre of gravity must lie
in the same vertical line with the centre of gravity of the volume
of displacement or “centre of buoyancy.”</p>

<p>The whole weight of the ship may be supposed to be concentrated
at her centre of gravity, and to act vertically downwards, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
resultant vertical pressure of the surrounding water in the same
way to act upwards through the centre of buoyancy.</p>

<p>When the ship has been inclined from the upright position, by any
force, the downward and the upward forces—weight and buoyancy
respectively—act through two separate but parallel vertical lines,
and form what is technically known as a “couple.” The perpendicular
distance between the vertical lines usually varies with the
inclination, and is called the “arm” of the couple. This arm
measures the leverage with which the weight and buoyancy of the
ship tend either to force her back into the upright position, or to
incline her still further, and, it may be, to capsize her. The former
effect would be the result of what is known as a “righting couple,”
the latter the result of an “upsetting couple.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig14_15" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <span class="fs80">FIG. 14. FIG. 15.</span>
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig14_15.jpg" alt="Cross section of tilted hull marked with
Centers of Gravity and Buoyancy">
</figure>

<p>This may be made clearer by illustration. On Figs. 14 and 15,
which show in outline a vessel’s midship section, the vessel being
inclined to a small angle, <b>G</b> represents the centre of gravity of
vessel, and <b>B</b> the centre of buoyancy. The water line <b>W.L.</b> corresponding
to the upright position, in the inclined position becomes
<b>W<sub>1</sub>.L<sub>1</sub>.</b>, and the centre of buoyancy <b>B</b> shifts out on the immersed
side of the vessel to <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>. Assuming in the case of Fig. 14 that
some external force not involving any shifting of the centre of
gravity has produced the inclination, then the weight of the vessel
acts downwards through <b>G</b>, and the buoyancy of her displacement
acts upwards through <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>, as indicated by the arrows passing through
these points. The combined effect of these forces, in this case, is
to rotate the vessel towards the upright, <em>i.e.</em>, it forms a “righting
couple.” Fig. 15 illustrates a case of the opposite kind. The angle
of inclination may be supposed to be greater than in Fig. 14, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the centre of gravity <b>G</b> is much higher in the vessel. The vertical
through <b>B<sub>1</sub></b> is to the left instead of to the right of the vertical through
<b>G</b>. The effect of the forces in this case is to rotate the vessel in
the direction of inclining her still further, and to capsize her—<em>i.e.</em>,
it forms an “upsetting couple.” A line at <b>G</b>, therefore (Fig. 14),
taken at right angles to the new vertical line, gives the distance
which corresponds to the righting arm (<b>G</b> <b>Z</b>). A similar line at <b>G</b>
(Fig. 15) represents the upsetting arm. The lengths of these arms
when multiplied into the displacement, gives the “moments” at
the respective degrees of inclination. The “curve of stability”
for a vessel is simply a graphic representation of these arms or
moments. When calculated for the various degrees of inclination,
they are set off as ordinates along a base line—the righting arms or
moments above, and the upsetting arms or moments below, the line—at
distances corresponding to the number of degrees in the respective
inclinations. A curve drawn through the extremities of these
ordinates is the curve of stability.</p>

<p>The two points above named whose relative positions are vitally
concerned with this subject—<em>i.e.</em>, centre of buoyancy and centre of
gravity—are determined by shipbuilders for many of their vessels,
although the stability may not be calculated to its full extent. The
position of the centre of buoyancy is easily ascertained from, and
in fact usually forms part of, the displacement calculation. While
the position of centre of gravity may be found by means of calculation
alone, <em>i.e.</em>—by the process of estimating the position of the
centre of gravity of each of the component parts, and from this
deducing the common centre of gravity of the whole ship—the work
is so laborious, complex, and so liable to error, that it is scarcely ever
adopted at the present day by mercantile shipbuilders. The position
can be ascertained with comparative ease and greater accuracy by
means of “inclining” experiments with the finished vessel, or closely
estimated before-hand by means of data obtained in the manner
alluded to from previous vessels of similar type.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Another point concerned with stability is that termed the “metacentre,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
which is found by calculation from the lines of the vessel.
Referring to Fig. 14, a vertical line drawn through the centre
of buoyancy <b>B<sub>1</sub></b> cuts the original vertical line at <b>M</b>. The intersection
<b>M</b>, when the vessel is inclined to an indefinitely small
angle, is the “metacentre.” It is approximately the same in all
ordinary vessels for inclinations less than say 10°, but varies with
greater inclinations. The corresponding intersections of the consecutive
vertical lines for all degrees of inclination are embraced in
the term “metacentrique.” These features in stability investigations
were originated by Bouguer, to whom reference has already
been made. The manner in which they are concerned with stability
will be indicated further on. (See also <a href="#Footnote_6">footnote on preceding page</a>.)</p>
</div>

<h3>RESISTANCE POWER AND SPEED.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A ship, in moving through the water, experiences resistance due
to a combination of causes, which combination, according to modern
accepted theory, is made up of three principal elements.</p>

<p>1st—“Frictional” or “skin friction” resistance, due to the particles
of water rubbing against the ship’s hull;</p>

<p>2nd—“Eddy-making” resistance, due to local disturbances or
eddies amongst the particles of water—almost wholly at stern of ship;</p>

<p>3rd—Surface disturbance of the water by the passage of the ship,
resulting in the creation and maintenance of waves: known as
“wave-making” resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>The conditions which govern each of these elements, and their
relative importance, may be generally indicated.</p>

<p>Surface-friction resistance, especially for vessels moving at
moderate or slow speeds, is much greater than the resistance due to
other causes—that is if the hull is ordinarily well formed. Its
amount depends upon the area of the immersed surface, upon its
length, upon its degree of roughness, and upon the velocity with
which the water glides over it—<em>i.e.</em>, upon the speed of the vessel.</p>

<p>Eddy-making resistance only acquires importance in exceptional
cases, <em>e.g.</em>, in ships having unusually full sterns. In ordinary well-formed
ships it is of small amount, and is caused mainly by blunt
projections such as shaft tubes, propeller brackets, and stern-posts.</p>

<p>Wave-making resistance is much more variable than surface-friction
resistance. Its amount depends on the form and proportions
of vessels, and on the speed at which they move: being greatest, of
course, in ships of full form and in those moving at high speeds.</p>

<p>The sum of these three main elements of resistance constitutes
the total resistance experienced by a vessel if “towed” through
the water, that is, the resistance considered apart from the action
or influence of the propelling instrument. In the case of a steamship,
however, propelled by a screw or paddle-wheels, the resistance
is augmented, more or less considerably, according to the form,
surface, and disposition of the propelling instrument.</p>

<p>By the employment of various formulæ deduced by scientific
authorities from theory and experiment, an approximation can be
made before-hand to the total resistance of a proposed vessel, and
from this an estimate of the power required to drive her at a certain
speed. Moreover, through the law of comparison propounded by
Mr Froude, the resistance of a ship can at all times be deduced with
fair accuracy from the resistance of her model, certain corrections
well determined by experiment having to be made.</p>

<p>The power of marine engines is expressed either in “nominal” or
“indicated” horse-power. Nominal horse-power is a term practically
obsolete so far as being a measure of the efficiency of engines, and
only exists as a conventional method of commercially measuring the
sizes of engines. Indicated horse-power measures the work done by
the steam in the cylinders during a unit of time, and 33,000 units of
work per minute, or 550 units of work per second, constitute one horse-power.
The effective mean pressure of the steam is ascertained from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
diagrams drawn by means of the instrument known as the “Steam
Engine Indicator,” and hence the term “indicated” horse-power.</p>

<p>The development by a vessel’s engines of the power requisite to
drive her at a certain speed is always very considerably more than
the power required simply to overcome her total resistance at that
speed. This excess of power developed over power usefully employed
in overcoming resistance is known as “waste work.” It
amounts in many cases to as much as from 50 to 60 per cent. of the
gross indicated power, and it is absorbed mainly as follows:—In
overcoming frictional and other resistances of the engines and shafting,
working air pumps, &amp;c., and in overcoming the frictional and
edgeways resistance of the propeller. The residue of power usefully
employed is known as the ‘effective’ horse-power. The respective
causes of ‘waste’ and their relative amounts are problems constantly
demanding solution. Progressive speed trials with actual vessels
and experiments with small scale models are daily contributing to
their solution, and to some extent to their reduction.</p>
</div>

<h3>STRUCTURAL STRENGTH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Considering a ship as floating in a state of rest in still water, the
volume of displacement represents a weight of water equal to the
weight of the ship. This equality, however, does not exist evenly
throughout the length of the vessel, or for individual portions:
thus, amidships the weight of water displaced by a given length—in
other words, the buoyancy—is usually considerably in excess of
the weight of that portion of the vessel and her contents. Similarly
at the extremities the ‘weight’ of a certain length exceeds the
‘buoyancy.’ Between the part or parts of the vessel in which
there is excess of buoyancy over weight, and the part or parts in which
the weight exceeds the buoyancy, there must obviously be sections
of the ship at which the two are equal, and these are termed “water
borne” sections. A ship circumstanced as described is in a condition
similar to that of a beam supported at the middle and loaded at
each end. Such a beam tends to become curved, the ends dropping
relatively to the middle, and the ends of the ship tend to drop similarly,
the change of form being called “hogging.” On the other
hand, if the excess of buoyancy occurred at the extremities and that
of weight amidship, the ship would resemble a beam supported at the
ends and loaded at the middle. In such a condition the middle would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
tend to drop relatively to the ends: a change of form called “sagging.”</p>

<p>These general principles are much more readily and safely applicable
to ships while floating in ‘still water’ than to ships when at
sea—the strains experienced then being necessarily the results of
far more complex and severe influences. The existence of waves
and their rapid motions relatively to that of the vessel, and the
pitching, heaving, and other movements thus caused, increase the
inequality of distribution of weight and buoyancy and affect more
materially the strains brought upon vessels. Consideration of the
problem, therefore, involves a study of waves, both as to their formation
and action, and necessarily leads to a mode of treatment which
cannot have accurate regard for particular cases. Variable influences
of immense importance are also constituted by the state of loading
in vessels for merchant service. For a uniform basis of comparison
in these calculations such vessels are usually assumed as loaded
with homogeneous cargo—<em>i.e.</em>, cargoes of equal density throughout.</p>

<p>This fundamental element of relative ‘weight’ and ‘buoyancy’
having been indicated, the chief strains to which a ship is subjected
may now be stated. This may be done with sufficient regard to
general accuracy, under four heads:—<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquotx pad1">

<p>(1) Strains tending to produce longitudinal bending—“hogging”
or “sagging”—in the structure considered as a whole.</p>

<p>(2) Strains tending to alter the transverse form of a ship, <em>i.e.</em>,
to change the form of athwartship sections.</p>

<p>(3) Strains incidental to propulsion by steam or sails.</p>

<p>(4) Strains affecting particular parts of a ship, or “local strains”—tending
to produce local damage or change of form independently
of changes in the structure considered as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To these might be added various other strains, which, however,
are of less practical importance, and are not felt in any great degree—except
in very special cases and under unusual circumstances—apart
from the strains which affect the structure considered as a
whole. The provisions made for the latter are, under ordinary
circumstances, sufficient to cover the demands of the former, but
particular cases may have to be provided for on their merits, apart
from the treatment generally applicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>The manner of ascertaining the strength of a ship to resist strains
tending to produce longitudinal bending, is to compute the effective
sectional area of all the longitudinal items in the structure which
are brought under compressive or tensile strain, and from this to
calculate the strength in the same manner as for a girder having an
aggregate sectional area and a disposition of material equivalent to
that of the ship.</p>

<p>To ascertain the accurate maximum strains tending to produce
longitudinal bending, or, in excessive cases, to break the ship across
at the transverse section where the strains reach their maximum,
involves a careful and most laborious consideration of the relative
weight and buoyancy of individual sections throughout the length,
and is a task not generally undertaken in mercantile shipyards.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>References to the nature of the transverse and other strains above
enumerated and the extent to which they have been investigated will
be made further on.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to such fundamental properties of vessels as
displacement, weight, and carrying capability, nothing new has
for a long period been added to the fund of scientific knowledge.
One of the conditions now most commonly laid down by the
owners of a proposed ship is that which provides for a certain
carrying capability on a given draught of water and at a
certain speed, the principal dimensions of the vessel also being
stipulated. The problem of determining what total displacement
will be required, involves consideration and an estimate
of—1st, The total weight of hull having regard to structural
strength; 2nd, the total weight of machinery having regard to
speed required. By using “co-efficients” deduced from the
weights of vessels of similar type already built,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> these are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
determined; and adding them to the carrying capability or
dead-weight stipulated, the required displacement can be closely
approximated to. For vessels of abnormal proportions or of
very unusual construction careful and detailed calculations of
the weight of materials are undertaken previous to tendering
for them. In some yards, indeed, a like degree of care is
observed in ordinary cases: methods of approximation involving
the use of co-efficients such as that based on cubic capacity
being distrusted.</p>

<p>The further problem of determining what form of hull will
give the required displacement is the essential and all-embracing
feature of the work of design, as it involves consideration
of almost all other properties. The methods of designing ships
are various, and a very common method, at one time more
followed than it now is, consists in shaping a block model
direct, and from it taking the necessary measurements for displacement,
and for full-size delineation in the moulding loft.
The disadvantages pertaining to this somewhat antiquated
method are becoming more recognised as shortened and exact
methods of linear or “draught plan” design are put forward.</p>

<p>Unless the plan of lines of a similar vessel of nearly the
same dimensions is at hand, the design of a new vessel is
in many instances done without previous calculation being
made to ensure at once obtaining the desired displacement.
Special methods of quickly arriving at this result are, however,
not uncommon in mercantile shipyards, and generally speaking
the chief draughtsmen in the employ of large firms doing a
varied class of work have rules derived from long experience,
though not perhaps definitely systematised, by which they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
guided.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Irrespective of all such special methods, however, the
work of designing is now greatly shortened and simplified by
means of Amsler’s “planimeter,” an ingenious instrument for
measuring areas now becoming well known.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> By employing
the instrument in question, the draughtsman need not too
laboriously strive after the exact displacement at first, as the
time occupied in ascertaining what displacement any set of
lines gives, and in the consequent fining or filling out, is very
considerably less than by the ordinary methods.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The question of stability, which has next to be considered,
is one of great difficulty and intricacy, and it was not till the
middle of last century that some of the principles upon which
it depends began to be understood. Bouguer showed in 1746
that the position of the “metacentre” limits the height to which
the centre of gravity of a floating body may be raised without
making it unstable, and that the righting moments at small
angles of inclination from a position of stable equilibrium are
proportional to the height of the metacentre above the centre
of gravity. As the position of the metacentre for any given
draught of water is easily determinable when once the volume
of displacement and the centre of buoyancy at that draught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
have been ascertained, it has been the practice for a very
long time to construct a curve representing the height of the
metacentre at all draughts, and to use it for showing the limits
above which the centre of gravity cannot be raised with due
regard to the stability required for the practical working of
vessels and for purposes of safety: By the method of “inclining”
vessels, already described (see outline of fundamental principles,
<a href="#Page_98">page 98</a>), the determination of the precise position of the centre
of gravity is rendered comparatively simple.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>While the vertical distance between the centre of gravity and
the metacentre—commonly termed the “metacentric height”—forms
a measure of the “initial stability,” or the stability
at very small angles of inclination, it is imperfect by itself,
and may be very misleading as regards the stability at larger
angles. This was conclusively demonstrated by Atwood in his
papers read before the Royal Society in 1796 and 1798, while
other grounds for discrediting the standard of stability furnished
by mere metacentric height were discovered subsequently, and
have been signally emphasised, with additional reasons, by
recent occurrences. Atwood, in the papers referred to, laid
down a general theorem for determining the righting moments
at any required angles of inclination possessed by a ship having
a given draught of water and a fixed height of centre of gravity,
the principle of which involved the use of the moments of the
volumes of the “Wedges,” <em>i.e.</em>, those parts of a vessel (see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span><b>W O W<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>L<sub>1</sub> O L</b>, fig. 15), which become immersed and emerged as
she is inclined. Several methods of simplifying Atwood’s calculations
had been devised previous to 1861,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but in that year
Mr F. K. Barnes, in a paper read before the Institution of
Naval Architects, described a method of accomplishing this
which until within recent years has been the one ordinarily
adopted in computing the stability of a vessel at various angles
of inclination.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Owing to questions having arisen at the Admiralty in 1867
respecting the stability of some low freeboard monitors at very
large angles of inclination, Sir E. J. Reed, then Chief Constructor,
directed the matter to be investigated. The work was
placed in the hands of Mr William John, who embodied for
the first time the results of the calculations in the form of a
curve of stability, which exhibited the variations of righting
moments with angles of inclination up to the particular angle
at which stability vanished. The entire range of a vessel’s
stability was thus made evident, and in such a form as enabled
the general problem to be far more comprehensively and
accurately treated than before. The results of Mr John’s
labours were described in a paper read by Sir E. J. Reed before
the Institution of Naval Architects in 1868, and a further
paper, containing an improved method of applying Atwood’s
theorem to the calculation of stability upon this extended
scale, was read before the same Institution by Messrs John
and W. H. White in 1871. The loss of H.M.S. <i>Captain</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
1870, as already pointed out near the beginning of this chapter,
occasioned an immediate and serious regard for the stability of
war vessels. This disaster, with other losses at sea from instability,
also forcibly directed the attention of mercantile
naval architects to the subject, and investigations on the same
complete scale as those undertaken in the Admiralty have for
some years been adopted in a few leading mercantile shipyards.</p>

<p>In this way the peculiar dangers attaching to low freeboard,
especially when associated with a high centre of gravity, have
been pretty fully made known, but the character of the stability
which is often to be found associated with very light draught
appears to have escaped the attention it demands. Light
draught is often as unfavourable to stability as low freeboard,
and in some cases more so.</p>

<p>These truths were forced into prominence at the inquiry
held by Sir E. J. Reed on behalf of the Government into the
disaster which befell the <i>Daphne</i>, a screw-steamer of 460 tons
gross register, which capsized in the middle of the Clyde
immediately on being launched from the yard of the builders,
Messrs Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons, Linthouse, on July 3rd,
1883. Sir E. J. Reed, in his exhaustive report, published in
August, 1883, emphasised the lessons adduced at the inquiry
as to the peculiar dangers attaching to light-draught stability;
and Mr Francis Elgar, (now Professor of Naval Architecture in
Glasgow University), who was employed to make investigations
respecting the stability possessed by the <i>Daphne</i> at the time
of the disaster, did much to guide consideration of the subject
into this channel. In a letter to the <cite>Times</cite> on 1st September,
1883, Mr Elgar, by way of explaining portions of his evidence
at the inquiry, called attention to the relation which exists
between the righting moments at deep and light draughts in
certain elementary forms of floating bodies, his communication
throwing further light on the subject of light-draught stability.
It appears that the fundamental proposition which underlies
the variations in the stability of a floating body with draught
of water had never before been demonstrated or enunciated.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that a curve of stability for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
given draught of water and position of centre of gravity ceases
to be applicable if changes are made in the weight and consequent
draught of water of a ship or the position of the centre
of gravity, or in both. Now in mercantile steamers, from the
extremely light condition in which they are launched to the
uncertain loaded condition of their daily service as cargo-carriers,
the variation of draught is very considerable, and
imports into the subject considerations which do not obtain to
any great extent in war ships.</p>

<p>To complete the representation of stability as it should be
known for merchant ships, it is now recognised that curves
showing the stability at every possible draught of water and for
different positions of centre of gravity should be constructed.
By means of “cross-curves” of stability, or curves representing
the variation of righting moment, with draught of water at
fixed angles of inclination, this comprehensive want can be
met with something like the necessary expedition. From
such curves it is a simple operation, involving no calculation
save measurement, to construct curves of the ordinary description,
showing the righting moment at all angles for any fixed
draught of water and position of centre of gravity. Professor
Elgar was the first to publicly direct attention to this valuable
development of stability investigation of merchant ships, doing
so in an able paper “On the Variation of Stability with Draught
of Water in Ships,” read before the Royal Society on March 13th
of the present year. Simultaneously with Prof. Elgar’s employment
of such curves in actual practice their use had been
independently instituted by Mr William Denny in his firm’s
drawing office, and the mode in which they were worked out
in this case was communicated in a paper read by Mr Denny
in April of the present year before the Institution of Naval
Architects.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Several important improvements with respect to
simplifying and shortening calculation distinguish the method
employed by Mr Denny, and that gentleman, in the paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
referred to, accords individual credit to members of the scientific
staff in his firm’s employ, who, on being entrusted with the
work of calculation, brought considerable originality to bear
upon their labours. The cross-curves described by Prof. Elgar
were constructed from a series of curves of stability calculated
in the ordinary way. This, however (as pointed out in an after-note
to that gentleman’s Royal Society paper), is less simple and
very much less expeditious than the method carried out under
Mr Denny, which consists in calculating the cross-curves
directly by applying Amsler’s mechanical integrator<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to the
under-water portion of the ship instead of to the wedges of
immersion and emersion, thus determining at once the positions
of the vertical lines through the centres of buoyancy at the
required angles of inclination. As thus carried out a complete
set of cross-curves can be produced with about one-third the
labour involved in employing the older method. The ease and
rapidity with which ordinary curves for separate draughts can
be taken from cross-curves has already been commented upon.</p>

<p>Many other investigators besides those already mentioned
have recently been working at the subject of stability, and a
considerable number have read papers, dealing with the extension
and simplification of stability calculations, before one
or other of the scientific societies concerned with naval
architecture, most of the methods put forward being well
worthy of study.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> To very many shipbuilders, however, and
to others besides them responsible for the stability of ships,
processes of arithmetical calculation—even allowing for all the
simplification which mathematical skill has recently effected—appear
still to be too intricate, or to absorb too much time
for their being entirely followed. As a simple means of readily,
although approximately, arriving at the results attained more
elaborately and reliably by calculation, attention has recently
been directed to an experimental process by which a complete
curve of stability may be constructed almost without the use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of a single figure! The method was first brought forward in
1873 by Capt. H. A. Blom, chief constructor of the Norwegian
Navy, formerly a student of the South Kensington School of
Naval Architecture, who described it to the United Service
Institution. The method has been employed by shipbuilding
firms on the Tyne and Clyde when a curve of stability had
to be produced in a very limited time, and when extreme accuracy
was not a desideratum. As practised by the firms in
question, the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> differs in some slight respects from
that described by Captain Blom, but the changes in no way
affect the principles as first laid down by him. The modern
mode of procedure may be briefly described:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the body plan of the ship, <em>i.e.</em>, that portion of the draught plan representing
the vessel’s form by a series of equidistant transverse sections—any
convenient number of sections lip to the load water-line are pricked upon and
then cut out of a sheet of drawing paper of uniform thickness. These sections
are then gummed together in their correct relative positions, care being taken
to spread the gum thinly and evenly. This paper model—greatly foreshortened, of
course—represents the immersed portion of the ship (in other words, the displacement)
when she is floating upright. By suspending this model from two different
points, and taking the intersection of two vertical lines through the points of
suspension—or better still, by balancing it horizontally on a pin and fixing
the point when the model is in equilibrium—the centre of gravity of the model,
or in other words, the actual centre of buoyancy is obtained.</p>

<p>Water lines at various angles of inclination are then drawn on the body plan,
all intersecting the water line for the upright condition at the centre line of
ship. The displacement represented by the inclined water lines thus drawn,
generally not being equal to that for the upright position, a correcting layer
has to be added or subtracted for each inclination, in order to obtain this end.
By employing the planimeter the necessary thickness of this layer can be most
readily ascertained. Where a planimeter is not available the actual floating
line may be obtained, after the model has been made, by cutting off layers,
allowance having been made for this purpose. The same number of sections
as before are then cut out to each of the inclined corrected water-lines, the
paper model prepared and the centre of buoyancy obtained as already described.</p>

<p>Through this new centre of buoyancy a line is drawn perpendicular to the
inclined water line, and the distance between this line and the centre of gravity
of the ship, already obtained, is the righting arm. If this process is repeated
for each angle of inclination, it is thus seen a complete curve of stability may
be approximately obtained.</p>

<p>A further method of arriving at results by experiment, involving
principles not unlike those of the “paper section”
method just described, has recently come under the author’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
notice, and through the courtesy of its inventor—Mr John H.
Heck, of Lloyd’s surveying staff at Newcastle—the following
general description of the apparatus and fundamental principles
is made public for the first time:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By means of a “stability balance,” roughly illustrated by Figs 16 and 17, in
conjunction with either an outside or inside model of the vessel, the moments of
stability can be practically determined. In practice, an inside model has been
found the most convenient to employ. This consists of a number of rectangular
pieces of yellow pine of any uniform thickness, out of which a portion has been
cut, respectively to the form of the vessel at equidistant intervals of say 15 feet.
These pieces, together with two end pieces, are kept together by four or six bolts,
thus forming a contracted model, the inside of which is of a similar form to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
that of the vessel. If this model is filled with water to a height corresponding
to any draught, it will represent a volume of water having the same form, and
proportional to the displacement of the vessel at that draught.</p>

<p>The stability balance consists of a frame <b>A</b> attached to a steel bar <b>Z</b>, having
knife edges working upon the support <b>C</b>; a table <b>D</b> attached to a spindle working
freely in the bearings <b>E</b>, and capable of being turned through any angle;
a sliding weight <b>F</b> to balance the weight of the model when empty; a sliding
weight <b>H</b> to balance and measure the weight of the water contained in inside or
displaced by outside models; a sliding balance weight <b>K</b> which by adjustment
will locate the centre of gravity of the combined weights of the table <b>D</b>, the
model and the weight <b>K</b> in the axis of the table <b>D</b>, so that the model will
remain when empty in any inclined position, and be balanced by the weight <b>F</b>.</p>

<p>In order to determine the moments of stability, the model is first fixed on the
table <b>D</b>, and the weights <b>F</b> and <b>K</b> so adjusted that <b>F</b> will balance the model
at all inclinations. The table is then brought into the upright position, and
water is poured into the model to the height corresponding to the desired
draught of water, and the weight <b>H</b> shifted until the whole is balanced. The
weight of water in the model will evidently be = weight <b>H</b> × its distance from
the fulcrum ÷ distance centre of model is from fulcrum.</p>

<p>If the table with the model is now turned through any angle, the distance the
centre of gravity of the water has moved from the axis <b>E</b> of the table can easily
be determined by shifting the weight <b>H</b> until the whole is balanced, then evidently
from the principles of the lever, <b>H</b> × by its distance from fulcrum =
weight of water in model × by the distance the centre of gravity of the water
in the model is from fulcrum. Since the weight of <b>H</b> × its distance from
fulcrum ÷ the weight of water in model is known, the distance that the centre
of gravity of the water has shifted from centre line is easily ascertained and the
righting lever determined.</p>
</div>

<p>From a lengthened series of experiments, conducted by Mr
Heck—latterly in Messrs Denny’s Works where an apparatus
from a special design by Mr Heck has been constructed for the
firm’s use—the method gives promise of taking a firm place
as an extremely simple and approximately accurate means of
arriving at the stability of vessels.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>While a vessel’s qualities with respect to stability may be
determined with great precision by the naval architect, his
investigations are only directly applicable to the ship while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
empty or when in certain assumed conditions of loading which
may or may not often occur in actual service. He cannot for
obvious reasons estimate, far less control, the amounts and
positions of centre of gravity of the various items of weight
that may make up the loading.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This aspect of the subject has
received attention at the hands of naval architects for a considerable
time, but the forcible way in which it has been brought
under view by recent experience has resulted in special efforts
being made to practically meet the necessities of the case. In
1877 Mr William John read a paper before the Institution of
Naval Architects, in which he dealt with the effect of stowage
on the stability of vessels, and since that time such authorities
as Martell, White, and Denny have given valuable papers or
made suggestive comments bearing on this important matter.
Much has also been done by several builders in the way of
devising diagrams useful for regulating stowage and manipulating
ballast with regard to initial stability. At the last
meeting of the Institution, Professor Elgar read a paper on
“The Use of Stability Calculations in Regulating the Loading
of Steamers,” distinguished by its eminently practical character,
and forming an important contribution to the solution of this
problem. The author disapproved of curves of stability being
supplied with vessels, as had been advised and was then becoming
the practice. General notes, giving in a simple form easily
applied in daily practice, particulars respecting the character of
a ship’s stability in different conditions, are what the author recommended
and had found through actual experience to meet
the case most effectually. In the discussion which followed it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
was intimated by Mr William Denny that his firm had already
resolved to furnish every new steamer produced by them with a
volume containing general and special notes and diagrams dealing
not only with stability but with several other important
technical properties (see <a href="#Footnote_6">footnote, page 59</a>). After consultation
with Professor Elgar, however, he had abandoned his intention
of supplying stability curves.</p>

<p>An arrangement designed to readily find the position of the
centre of gravity experimentally by inclining, and to indicate
at once the stability of loaded vessels as represented by metacentric
height, has been devised and introduced on board several
ships by Mr Alexander Taylor, of Newcastle—already referred
to in connection with the triple expansion principle in marine
engines. The instrument and apparatus, which he appropriately
names the “Stability Indicator,” was described in a
paper read by him before the Institution of Naval Architects at
its last meeting. When once an inclining operation has been
made, the degree of inclination is read from a glass gauge and
the position of centre of gravity and corresponding metacentric
height from a previously prepared scale set up alongside
the gauge, or from tabulated figures.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The advance made within recent years in connection with
steam propulsion comprises many matters necessarily left
unconsidered in the chapter on speed and power of modern
steamships. Scientific methods have undoubtedly contributed
in no small degree to the realization of the remarkable results
therein outlined. The achievement of one triumph after another
as demonstrated in the actual performances of new
vessels, and especially the confidence with which pledges of
certain results are given and received long before actual trials
are entered upon—and that sometimes with regard to ships embodying
very novel features—are evidences of the truth of this.</p>

<p>The oldest method of approximating to the horse-power
required to propel a proposed vessel at a given speed is to
compare the new ship with ships already built by the use of
formulæ known as “co-efficients of performance” deduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
from the results of their speed trials. Two such co-efficients
have been deduced from Admiralty practice, the one involving
displacement, the other area of mid-section, with speed as the
variable in both cases. Another method which has been largely
used, consists in first determining the ratio of the indicated
horse-power to the amount of “wetted surface,” or immersed
portion of the vessel’s skin, in the exemplar ship, and then estimating
from this ratio the probable value of the corresponding
ratio for the proposed ship at her assigned speed. Inasmuch
as these methods of procedure do not take account of the <em>forms</em>
of the hulls, and consequently of that factor in the total resistance
due to <em>wave-making</em>, they cannot be used with any degree
of confidence, or without large corrections, except in connection
with vessels whose speeds are moderate in proportion to their
dimensions: those in fact in which the resistance varies nearly
as the square of the speed. A further method, somewhat resembling
the one based upon the relation between indicated horse-power
and the “wetted surface,” was proposed by the late Prof.
Rankine, but has never been extensively employed. Apart from
the unreliable nature of the results which an application of it
gives—except for certain speeds—it is open to several serious
objections in practice.</p>

<p>A method of analysis and prediction, meeting with considerable
acceptance from shipbuilders on the Clyde and elsewhere,
has been introduced within recent years by Mr A. C. Kirk, of
Messrs R. Napier &amp; Sons.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The method consists in reducing
all vessels to a definite and simple form, such as readily admits
of comparison being made between their immersed surface,
length of entrance and angle of entrance and their indicated
horse-power, and from this judging of the form and proportions
best suited to a given speed or power in proposed vessels. The
form in question consists of a block model, having a rectangular
midship section, parallel middle body, and wedge-shaped
ends; its length being proportioned to that of the ship, its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
depth to the mean draught of water, its girth of mid-section
to the girth of immersed mid-section of the ship, and the surface
of its sides, bottom and ends, to the immersed surface of
the ship. By finding from one or more exemplar ships—the
selection of which is obviously governed by the conditions of
analysis—the rate of indicated horse-power required per unit
of wetted surface at the speed assigned for the proposed vessel,
the appropriate rate for the latter may easily be determined.</p>

<p>The data afforded by the modern system of progressive speed
trials, especially when taken in conjunction with that of experiment
with models as systematised by Mr Froude, supplies
in a reliable way much of what is most lacking in the older
methods of comparison and prediction. Progressive speed trials
on the measured mile were first systematically instituted by Mr
William Denny about nine years ago, since which it has been
the practice of his firm to make such trials with all their vessels.
The practice has been followed by other firms on the Clyde and
elsewhere, and there is every probability it will be still more
widely adopted in the future. The system consists in trying
the vessel at various speeds, ranging from the highest to about
the lowest of which she is capable. The several speeds are the
mean of two runs—one run with the tide and one against, the
object being to eliminate the tide’s influence from the results.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Essentially noteworthy in connection with the system is the
manner in which the data obtained from the trials is recorded
for future use. This consists of a series of curves, representing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the chief properties of ship, engines, and propeller—<em>e.g.</em>, “speed
and power,” “revolutions” and “slip”—which show to the eye,
more easily and clearly than bare figures, the whole course and
value of a steamer’s performances. For that of speed and
power the various speeds made at the trials are set off to
convenient scale as horizontal distances, and the indicated
horse-power corresponding to those speeds are set off to scale
as vertical distances. The intersection of the offsets so made,
give spots for the curve. The other curves alluded to are
<ins class="corr" id="tn-118" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'similiarly constructed'">
similarly constructed</ins>, the requisite data being the direct or
deduced results of the measured mile trials.</p>

<p>From the accumulation of trial results thus graphically
recorded the designer of new ships can proceed to estimate
with greater assurance of attaining satisfactory results than
by employing the older methods. If, for example, a ship
is to be built of virtually similar dimensions and form
to one for which such information is available, but of less
speed, the task is simply one of measurement from the curves,
with some allowance for probable differences in the constant
friction of the engines. If the speed is to be greater than that
of the exemplar ship, but still within the limits when wave-making
resistance assumes relative importance, the case is also
one of simple reading from the curves, with slight corrections.
When both the speed and size are different, but the form is
approximately the same, the case is more difficult, but it can
be dealt with approximately by employing the “law of comparison”
or of “corresponding speeds” enunciated by Mr Froude.
Formulæ based upon this law—which will be more fully
referred to presently—have been devised by one or two designers,
and applied by them to problems of the latter class
as they occurred in the course of their professional work. Mr
John Inglis, junr., described a method of analysis he had
adopted, involving the use of Mr Froude’s law, in a paper read
before the Institution of Naval Architects in 1877.</p>

<p>When unusual speeds are aimed at, or when novel types of
vessels have to be dealt with, the only available method of
making a trustworthy estimate of the power required lies in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the use of direct or deduced results from model experiments.
Mr Froude began the work of speed experiments with ships’
models on behalf of the Admiralty at the Experimental Tank
in Torquay about 1872, carrying it on uninterruptedly until
his death in May, 1879. Since that lamented event the work
has been continued with most gratifying results by his son,
Mr R. E. Froude. Experiments had, of course, been made by
many other investigators previous to Mr Froude, but none
before or since have made model experiments so practically
useful and reliable. Since the value of the work carried on at
Torquay has become appreciated, several experimental establishments
of a similar character have been instituted. The
Dutch Government, in 1874, formed one at Amsterdam, which,
up till his death in 1883, was under the superintendence of
Dr Tideman, whose labours in this direction were second only
to those of the late Mr Froude. It is now superintended by Mr
A. J. H. Beeloo, Chief Constructor, and under him by Mr H.
Cop. It was here, it may be remembered, that experiments were
made with a model of the Czar of Russia’s yacht <i>Livadia</i>, previous
to the construction of that extraordinary vessel being
begun by Messrs Elder &amp; Co. On the strength of the data so
obtained, together with the results of the trials made on Loch
Lomond with a miniature of the actual vessel, those responsible
for her stipulated speed were satisfied that it could be attained.
The actual results as to the speed of the novel vessel amply
justified the reliance put upon such experiments. In 1877
the French naval authorities established an experimental tank
in the dockyard at Brest, and the Italian Government have
formed one in the naval dockyard at Castellamare. The only
experimental tank hitherto established by a private mercantile
firm is that in the shipyard of Messrs Denny, Dumbarton. This
establishment is on a scale of completeness not surpassed elsewhere,
and is fitted with every appliance which the latest experience
in such experiments shows to be advantageous. A
special staff of experimentalists, forming a branch of the general
scientific body, are engaged conducting experiments and accumulating
data, which, besides being of service in their present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
daily practice, must ultimately yield fruit of a very special
kind to this enterprising firm.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>From mathematical reasoning, and by means of an extended
series of experiments with models and actual ships, Mr Froude
determined that for two vessels of similar form—for instance a
ship and her model—the “corresponding speeds” of ship and
model are to one another as the square roots of the similar
dimensions, and at corresponding speeds the resistance of ship
and of model are to one another as the cubes of the similar
dimensions—subject to a correction concerned with skin friction
necessitated by the difference in the lengths of ship and model.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Having obtained the resistance of a model, and from it, by
an application of the above law, deduced the resistance of the
full-sized vessel, the effective horse-power is found by multiplying
the resistance by the speed of the vessel in feet per minute,
and dividing by 33,000. From the effective horse-power an
estimate of the indicated horse-power required can be made
by using ratios which the one bore to the other in former ships,
as obtained from a comparison of their model experiments with
their measured mile trial results.</p>

<p>The value of progressive speed trials and of experiments
with models as affording convenient means whereby analysis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
may be made of the several sources of expenditure of power
in propelling vessels can scarcely be over-estimated.</p>

<p>From a study of the graphic records of progressive trials, and
from model experiment results, Mr Froude discovered a method
whereby the power expended in overcoming the frictional resistance
of the engines could be determined, and estimates made
of the amount of power absorbed by other elements. The method
in question was communicated in full in a paper read before the
Institution of Naval Architects in 1876, and has since been
extensively used. Methods of analysis resulting from a simultaneous
study of this subject, were also proposed by Mr Robert
Mansel, a prominent Clyde shipbuilder and noted investigator,
but they failed in meeting with the acceptance which was at
once accorded to Mr Froude’s propositions.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Although the results obtained by an application of Mr
Froude’s analysis to the trials of a large number of merchant
vessels have undoubtedly thrown considerable light on the
relative efficiency of hull and engines, and of various types of
engines, still, for several reasons adduced by extended experience—most
of which, indeed, were foreseen and perfectly
appreciated by Mr Froude himself—the need has been felt
for some means of directly measuring the power actually
delivered to the propellers by the engines when working at
different speeds. One of Mr Froude’s latest inventions, the
perfecting of which was not accomplished until after his death,
consisted of a dynamometric apparatus designed to accomplish
this important end.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The construction of the instrument was
undertaken for the Admiralty, and trials were made with it on
H.M.S. <i>Conquest</i> in the early part of 1880. The results of these
experiments have not yet in any form been recorded, but there
can be no question as to the benefit that would accrue to the
profession if the Admiralty could be induced to publish these,
as well as the results of other experiments with this instrument.</p>

<p>Experiments with actual vessels to <ins class="corr" id="tn-121" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'determine dircetly'">
determine directly</ins> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
relative efficiency of hull, engines, and propellers have on
several occasions been undertaken. A series of trials of this
nature were made in 1874 by Chief-Engineer Isherwood, U.S.
Navy on a steam launch, the results of which may be found
detailed in the Report of the Secretary of U.S. Navy for 1875.
Similar trials have been made recently on the United States
steamer <i>Albatros</i>, an interesting account of which appeared in
<cite>Engineering</cite> of October 17 of the present year. These experiments
are referred to as notable examples of what might be
carried out with great advantage on other and larger vessels,
although they are such, perhaps, as few single firms can well
be expected to follow extensively.</p>

<p>The economies which may be obtained by changes in the propellers
fitted to ships, and the great value of progressive speed
trials as a means of measuring the effects of such changes, received
most remarkable illustration in the results of the trials of H.M.S.
<i>Iris</i>, carried out for the Admiralty in 1880. These showed
that by simply varying the propellers—all other conditions remaining
practically unchanged—the speed of the ship was increased
from 16½ to 18½ knots per hour. Scarcely less striking
improvements in the performances of vessels due to changed
propellers might be found from the records of trials made with
merchant vessels within recent years.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as measured mile trials are usually carried out
when vessels are in the light or partially loaded condition, the
results are far from being so valuable as they might be made;
alike for the purposes of the naval architect, the shipowner,
and ships’ officers; if they were undertaken with vessels in the
completely laden condition. The information obtained from
the trials of incompletely laden vessels does not yield that
knowledge of a vessel’s qualities under the conditions necessarily
imposed by actual service, which, if possessed by naval
architects, would doubtless prove of immense value, nor does
it furnish that standard of comparison for performances at sea
which owners and captains should possess. In the interests
of all concerned, it is to be hoped the practice of trying loaded
vessels may become more common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Amongst the earliest and most notable investigations involving
the application of principle to the calculation of the
longitudinal strength of iron vessels were those by Sir William
Fairbairn, who contributed an elaborate statement of his views
and methods to the first meeting of the Institute of Naval
Architects in 1860. Investigation up till about this period,
almost wholly concerned itself with vessels considered as
girders, and in assumed conditions of fixed support, such as
being pivoted on rocks. Later investigations have shown these
conditions to be altogether too extreme and severe when compared
with the known and estimated strains which vessels are
called upon to bear in ordinary service. In 1861 Mr J. G.
Lawrie, of Glasgow, in an able paper on Lloyd’s rules, read
before the Scottish Shipbuilders’ Association,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> reasoning from
wave phenomenon and the probable effects attending motion
in a seaway, endeavoured to deduce limits or absolute values
for the extreme strains experienced by a vessel in the circumstances,
the results obtained by Mr Lawrie bearing very closely
on those deduced by later investigations. The late Professor
Rankine made investigations involving consideration of strains
in a seaway, and formulated several valuable rules which to
some extent are still accepted, although giving results which
are not likely to be exceeded in any case of ordinary service.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>For the most recent advances made in this important branch
of the science of naval architecture, the profession lies under
indebtedness chiefly to one or two naval architects of eminent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
ability, whose professional province for a time has lain more
especially in the way of a full consideration of the subject.
Sir E. J. Reed, while Chief Constructor of the Navy, and under
him several Government-trained naval architects subsequently
acquiring high positions, achieved much in accurate investigation
of iron-clad vessels of war. In 1870 the authority named
read an elaborate paper before the Royal Society dealing at
length with such work.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In 1874 Mr William John, formerly
under Sir E. J. Reed, but at that time Assistant Chief Surveyor
to Lloyd’s Register, read a valuable paper before the Institution
of Naval Architects, in which he gave the results of
investigations of specific cases, and of long and careful study
of the general problem as concerned with merchant vessels.
In this paper, Mr John advanced the proposition that the
maximum bending moment likely to be experienced on a wave
crest may be taken approximately as one thirty-fifth of the
product of the weight of the ship into her length. Proceeding
on this assumption Mr John’s paper further gave valuable results
of calculations made into the strength of a series of vessels
representing large numbers of mercantile steamers then afloat.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Of this paper and the conclusions it pointed to, Mr John, in a
later paper on “Transverse and other Strains of Ships,” said:—</p>

<p>“The investigations showed unmistakably that as ships increased in size a
marked diminution occurred in their longitudinal strength, and the results
caused some surprise at the time, although they might perhaps have been easily
inferred from the writings of others published at an earlier period. Those
results, in spite of their approximate character, impressed two conclusions
strongly on my mind: firstly, that there was cause for anxiety as to the longitudinal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
strength of some very large iron steamers then afloat, and that the
longitudinal strength of large ships needed on all hands the most careful vigilance
and attention; and secondly, that in small vessels, and even vessels of
moderate dimensions, the longitudinal strength need cause but little anxiety,
because it is amply provided for by the scantlings found necessary to fulfil the
other requirements of a sea-going trade.”</p>
</div>

<p>Using the formula as to the maximum bending moment
advanced by Mr John many investigations have been made
subsequently into the longitudinal strength of vessels, and
this increased interest in the subject has not been without its
effect on subsequent structural practice.</p>

<p>Mr John followed up his investigations on the longitudinal
strength of merchant vessels viewed as girders by an inquiry
into the transverse and other strains of ships, and in 1877
gave a valuable paper on the subject, from which a quotation
has already been made, before the Institution of Naval Architects.
The results of Mr John’s inquiry were such as demonstrated
the need for systematic and thorough investigation
of the subtle and intricate questions involved. This subject
has been matter of study at Lloyd’s Register for several
years, and in March, 1882, the results of inquiries conducted
by Mr T. C. Bead and Mr P. Jenkins, members of the staff
in London, and former students of the Royal Naval College,
Greenwich, were communicated in an able paper by these
gentlemen, read to the Institution of Naval Architects.</p>

<p>It will of course be understood that many investigations of
strength are instituted not necessarily out of fear that maximum
strains may not be adequately allowed for, but because the
dual quality of strength-with-lightness may possibly be better
attained by modifications in the arrangements of material or
sufficiently met by reduced scantling. The functions and
influence of the Registration Societies, already commented
upon (see <a href="#Footnote_8">footnote, page 103</a>), are such as to obviate the need
for strength investigations generally, or at least are such as to
discourage shipbuilders from independently instituting them.
Nevertheless, some well-known shipbuilders, who are also
notable investigators, amongst whom may be named Inglis,
Mansel, Denny, and Wigham Richardson, have done much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
valuable work in this connection. Mr Denny, in particular,
has vigorously devoted himself to strength analysis on the basis
of Lloyd’s methods of fixing scantling, and read several papers
on the subject, in which strong exception is taken to present
practice. The healthy criticism which such labours have enabled
those making them to offer regarding the Registry systems
of scantlings has not doubtless failed in influencing the legislation
of the Registries.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Reverting to the subject of agencies for education in naval
architecture, a few remarks are due relative to Government
institutions as having hitherto failed in being of immediate
service to the mercantile marine. The training given to naval
architects and marine engineers at the Admiralty Schools is
admirably adapted for creating a staff of war-ship designers and
expert mathematicians, such as are employed in the various
departments of the Admiralty service. The course of instruction
has been framed expressly with a view to this, and a very
high standard of mathematical knowledge is necessary before
students can enter upon it. The principle of requiring one to
become a first-class mathematician before attempting to teach
him much of the science of naval architecture and its application
in practice, is of questionable merit: at any rate it cannot
be carried out in the mercantile marine. Again; economy of
time and of cost of production are conditions which largely
govern the methods followed in mercantile practice. Short
methods of calculation, or of tentative approximation, for the
purpose of enabling tenders to be made for proposed vessels,
and of quickly proceeding with the work when secured, form
no inconsiderable feature in the training required by mercantile
naval architects. These, however, do not as a rule enter
to any extent into Admiralty modes of procedure.</p>

<p>The want of satisfactory means for obtaining a sound scientific
and practical training in mercantile naval architecture has
for some time been felt to be very pressing. The evening
classes conducted in most of the shipbuilding centres under the
auspices of the Science and Art Department, South Kensington,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
are fitted to supply a part of this want so far as elementary
teaching is concerned. Until recently the antiquated character
of the questions set for examination was subject of general complaint,
both on the part of students and teachers. In August,
1881, Mr William Denny read a paper on “Local Education in
Naval Architecture” before the Institution of Naval Architects,
in which adequate expression was given to these complaints,
and at the same time proposed amendments offered. As a consequence
of this paper, and of the steps taken by the Institution
in appointing a deputation to wait upon the Government, the
questions have been considerably improved, and are now so
framed as to form a fairly crucial test of a young student’s
knowledge of the science and practice of modern shipbuilding.</p>

<p>During the past three years efforts have been made by the
Council of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in
Scotland<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> to supply more adequate means of advanced education.
In 1880, the Council had before them a project, promoted,
for most part independently, by Mr Robert Duncan and others,
to establish a Lectureship of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering. It was proposed to collect funds sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
endow the lectureship under the auspices of the University, and
promises of substantial aid were obtained from several members.
Mr J. G. Lawrie volunteered to give the first course of lectures
and did so, according to arrangement, during the winter months
of 1881-82 before a considerable number of students, the lectures
being delivered in the University of Glasgow during the day, and
repeated in the Institution rooms in the evening. These praiseworthy
efforts were still being carried on when, in November,
1883, the gratifying announcement was made of a gift of £12,500
by Mrs John Elder, widow of the late eminent engineer, for
the endowment of a Chair of Naval Architecture in the University.
The founding of this chair, and the subsequent election
by the University Court of Mr Francis Elgar to the Professorship,
have thus doubtless obviated the need for further efforts
to found the lectureship, but there are many commendable
objects connected with the University Chair to which the continued
efforts of the gentlemen who supported the lecture
project might fittingly be directed. Many students who can
afford it will doubtless study the higher branches of naval
architecture at Glasgow University, and if a few small University
scholarships were established, for which all classes of workers
in the shipyards and drawing offices might compete, the highest
professional training would then be within the reach of the
poorest of lads.</p>

<p>Evidences have recently been given of a strong desire on
the part of many engaged in the shipbuilding and engineering
industries of the Tyne and Wear for the founding of a Chair
of Naval Architecture in some educational institution in that
district. Along with this movement a desire has been shown
for the establishment of an Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders
such as has been so long carried on successfully in
the Clyde district. Definite steps are about to be taken for
the realisation of these important objects, and doubtless no
great time will elapse before they are accomplished.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="fs80">PROGRESS IN METHODS OF SHIPYARD WORK.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Since the early days of iron shipbuilding, when hand labour
entered largely into almost all the operations of the shipyard,
the field of its application has been gradually narrowed by the
employment of machinery. The past few years have been
uncommonly fruitful of changes in this direction, and many
things point to the likelihood of manual work being still more
largely superseded by machine power in the immediate future.
Such changes, however, have not, as might be assumed, had
any very sensible effect in diminishing the number of operatives
generally employed. The influence has rather been
absorbed in the greatly increased rate of production, and the
elaboration and enhanced refinement of detail demanded by
the much more exacting standard of modern times. The need
for skilled handicraftsmen may not now be so general, but the
skill which is still indispensable is of a higher character, and
has called into existence several almost entirely new classes
of shipyard operatives.</p>

<p>The extended employment of machinery has given impetus
to, and received impetus from, the system of “piece-work”
now so much in vogue in shipyards. In several of the operations,
such as riveting and smithing, the nature of the work
peculiarly lends itself to the system, and piece-work has
consequently been in force, as regards these operations, for
many years. In several other departments, however, such as
plate and bar fitting, joinery, <ins class="corr" id="tn-129" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and carpentery'">
and carpentry</ins>, piece-work is
only contemporaneous with and largely the consequence of
improved modern machinery. Reference to “piece-work” here
is not made with the intention of discussing its effects on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
labour question—concerned as this is with such large issues—but
simply of showing what effect the system has had on the
character of shipyard workmanship. It was a favourite argument
some years ago, when piece-work was being rapidly
extended, that the system was bad because it would lead to
and foster scamp-work and bad workmanship. The results of
the past dozen years’ experience disprove this completely, and
for reasons which, as early as 1877, were pointed out by Mr
William Denny—to whose spirited advocacy and adoption of
the system its present degree of acceptance with workmen is in
no small measure owing. In his admirably written pamphlet
on “The Worth of Wages,” published in the year named, Mr
Denny says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to piece-work leading to bad workmanship, this would certainly be the
result were no special arrangements made to prevent it. These special arrangements
include a rigid system of inspecting the work, and the rejection, at the
workman’s cost, of all bad and inferior work. There is no difficulty in carrying
out such a system, for foremen, freed from the necessity of watching the quantity
of the work—which is looked after by a special clerk—and of checking the
laziness of their men, can give their whole attention to the matter of quality.
In fact, piece-work compels so thorough an inspection, that we find the work
done under it in our iron department much superior to what used to be done
some years ago on time. It is very curious that trades’ unionists never have
been very anxious as to the quality of their work till they had piece-work to
contend with, and I have never known workmen produce such good work, as
after a few experiences of having their workmanship condemned for its bad
quality, and the cost taken out of their pockets. Under the old time wages no
such effective stimulus urged a man on to make his piece of work up to a
proper standard.”</p>
</div>

<p>What was true of the system as exemplified in Messrs
Denny’s experience previous to 1877, holds equally good for
all the yards in which piece-work is now the rule. Under it
work is done quicker and better than by the old system, and
so popular is it amongst workmen that a deep-rooted dislike
for “time-work” prevails where piece-work has once been
instituted and efficiently managed.</p>

<p>The machines in use at the present day for preparing the
separate and multitudinous pieces of material which go to form
the hull structure of iron and steel vessels are both numerous
and highly efficient. This work of preparing material, it may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
be shortly stated, mainly consists of shearing and planing the
edges of plates and bars—these as supplied by the manufacturers
being, of course, only approximately near the final
form and dimensions—rolling and flattening or giving uniform
curvature to plates; bending angle or other bars, such as are
used for deck beams; and punching the holes through plates
and bars for the reception of rivets. In this list regard is not
had to the operations concerned with material in the heated
state, the features requiring to be thus manipulated being
mainly the frames of the vessel; the work being effected without
the aid of any special machine tools. A small proportion
of the plating also requires to be operated upon in this state,
and for this purpose machine tools are sometimes brought into
requisition, some notice of which will be taken further on.</p>

<p>While most of the machines have been introduced for a
period exceeding that with which our review is more directly
concerned, improved types have been made, and entirely new
machines brought into requisition during recent times. The
universal adoption of piece-work in almost all the departments
of construction has demanded a more economical type of
machine than formerly. In this way punching machines,
which play so important a part in shipyards, have risen from
a working speed of about fourteen rivet holes per minute to
thirty and even—in the case of frame punching—to as high as
forty per minute. Other machines have had a corresponding
increase in speed; in several of the best appointed yards the
general increase being about sixty per cent.</p>

<p>The introduction of the double bottom for water ballast in
ships, brought about a great increase in the amount of necessary
punching caused by the numerous man-holes required
through the floors and longitudinals. These man-holes, oval
in shape as shown by Fig. 1—of say 18-ins. by 12-ins.—had
to be punched all round by the rivet-punch, and the edges
afterwards dressed by hand with a chisel. To economise
work in this connection, need was felt for a machine which
would be capable of punching a man-hole of the ordinary size
out of the thickest plate at one operation. In 1879, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
request of one of the prominent Clyde firms, Messrs Craig &amp;
Donald, the well-known machine-tool makers of Johnstone,
introduced a man-hole punching machine which cut holes
18-ins. by 12-ins. at the rate of seven per minute, in such a
way that no after-dressing with chisels was required. This
machine, an ordinary eccentric motion one driven by its own
engine, although tested and found capable of cutting an 18-in.
by 12-in. hole through a plate 1-in. thick, was superseded in
the yard for which it was made, by another, designed to meet
the requirements of the heaviest type of vessels built on the
cellular principle. This machine—also made by Messrs Craig
&amp; Donald, and five or six of which are now at work in yards
on the Clyde and at Barrow—was capable of piercing a hole
30-ins. by 21-ins. through a plate ¾-ins. thick, at one operation,
and was actuated by hydraulic power. The ordinary eccentric
machine, driven by engine attached, is still in favour for
lighter work, and machines of this type are at work in several
of the East Coast yards capable of punching holes up to 21-ins.
by 15-ins. through plates ¾-ins. thick.</p>

<p>Reverting to the subject of the proportion of material requiring
to be heated before manipulation, it is noteworthy that the
employment of mild steel is a source of economy in this connection
as well as in the many others already noticed. The
<ins class="corr" id="tn-132" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'superior homogeniety'">
superior homogeneity</ins> and great ductility of the material
favours cold-bending when such an operation would be fatal
to iron. Not only does an economy in labour result, but
incidentally there is a further advantage. Cold-bending distresses
steel less than hot-bending, and the special precautions
so often taken, in the way of annealing, to toughen steel which
has been operated upon when hot, are thus obviated.</p>

<p>A certain proportion of the bottom plates in a ship—<em>e.g.</em>,
those adjoining the keel—and a few at the stern and elsewhere,
have quick bends and twists which are much more difficult to
treat than the easy and generally uniform curvatures on the
plates of the bilge. The latter are effected in great measure
by the “bending rolls” with the plates perfectly cold, but the
former have to be made with the plate in the heated state.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Hydraulic presses have been used for this purpose for some
years, a certain proportion of the work done being the manipulation
of plates while cold. With steel as the material to
be operated upon, these machines are being more and more
utilised in this direction, and their presence in the shipyard, as
in boiler works, is sure to become more and more prevalent.
The operations of the shipyard, in short, have been gaining in
exactitude every year, and have borrowed both in the matters
of methods and of appliances from the marine boiler works,
where machine tools are more conspicuously a feature. Machine
tools for riveting, now playing so important a part in shipyards,
first had their utility approved in boiler shops, and the
introduction of improved types of drilling machines is largely
the reflected successes attending them there.</p>

<p>From the foregoing imperfect sketch of the principal directions
in which machine tools used in <em>preparing material</em> for the
constructive stage have been improved or recently introduced,
it will be gathered that hydraulic power in lieu of steam has
taken a prominent place in shipyards. That this is so to a
remarkable extent will sufficiently appear from what follows
regarding the appliances used in the work of <em>binding the
structure</em> of vessels. It may, however, be premised that in
several establishments hydraulic pressure has now displaced
steam power in almost all the machine-tools used in the iron
departments. This is so in the case of the Naval Dockyards
of Toulon and Brest, in France, and of the Spanish naval
establishments at Ferrol, Cadiz, &amp;c.; the machinery in the
former of which was fully described in June, 1878, before the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers, by M. Marc Berrier-Fontaine,
of the French Navy. The plant and machinery are
by Mr Ralph H. Tweddell, C.E., of Delahay Street, London,
whose numerous inventions and great experience in this special
branch of engineering are well worthy of recognition. The
machines comprise those for punching, shearing, angle cutting,
plate bending, and riveting, and the author referred to is high
in his praise of the superior efficiency and economy of the
hydraulic system, as exemplified in practice. One or two of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
the leading advantages of the system may be here summarised.
Hydraulic machines do not consume any power at all during
the interval between employment, and the power can be applied
at any moment without preparatory consumption, and stopped
equally quick. No shafting or belting is required, and the
wear and tear of continuous motion, as in steam machines, is
thus obviated. The power exerted is much more gradual
than that of steam, performing the work more thoroughly, and
with less liability to strain or otherwise damage the material
operated upon, or the tool itself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Although hydraulic machinery was successfully introduced
by Sir William Armstrong so long ago as 1836, and has since
been applied by him and others in almost every direction
the application of hydraulic power to machines for constructive
purposes is of comparatively modern date. Its early employment
as the motive power for machine-tools was in the case
of machines which were “stationary” or “fixed” in position
when in use. Machines for riveting purposes in boiler shops
and locomotive works were the first tools of any note to which
hydraulic power transmitted from a distance was applied, but
even this dates back only to about 1865. In that year Mr
R. H. Tweddell, already referred to, designed hydraulic plant,
consisting of pumps, an accumulator, and a riveting machine,
which were first used by Messrs Thompson, Boyd &amp; Co., Newcastle-on-Tyne,
with satisfactory results. The work was done
perfectly, and at about one-seventh of the cost of hand work,
and the same power was utilized in actuating hydraulic
presses for such purposes as setting or “joggling” angle or tee
irons. Excellence and economy of work were thus secured;
and in a comparatively short time above 100 machines were
at work in various dockyards and large works.</p>

<p>Although patent designs for portable hydraulic riveters
existed before 1871, it was not till that year that any form of
<ins class="corr" id="tn-134" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'portable rivetters'">
portable riveters</ins> was applied in practice with any degree of
success. Previous to that year the frames of ships had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
riveted by Mr Tweddell’s stationary hydraulic machines, but a
portable riveter invented by that gentleman in 1871 was then
tried, when it was thoroughly demonstrated that during a working
day of 10 hours the machine was capable of closing 1,000
rivets. Not much encouragement, however, was received from
shipbuilders at the time, owing chiefly to the fact that the wages
for riveting labour was not then a very urgent question. On a
modification of the general plan of working, these machines being
proposed by their inventor in 1876, they received more cordial
recognition from shipbuilders thereafter. It is only, however,
within the past five years or so that <ins class="corr" id="tn-135" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'portable rivetters'">
portable riveters</ins> have been so extensively introduced into shipbuilding yards. The
success which has attended them during the period leaves no
reasonable doubt as to their ultimate place in every well-appointed
shipbuilding establishment. Already the majority
of Clyde shipyards—including all the larger ones—and most
of the yards in the Tyne and Wear districts, are furnished
with hydraulic riveting machines and plant, overtaking work
constantly, efficiently, and with greatly reduced expense, that
is matter of envy in yards not similarly favoured. In most
of the larger Clyde yards the Tweddell machinery and plant
are employed; but in some cases machines introduced by Mr
William Arrol, Dalmarnock Ironworks, Glasgow—chiefly for
riveting the frames, beams, &amp;c.—are used. The Arrol machines
work on a similar principle to those of Mr Tweddell, whose
system is practically the only one in use on the Tyne and the
Wear, and at Barrow.</p>

<p>The prime cost of furnishing a complete hydraulic plant is
of course considerable, and such as might perhaps appear an
outlay not speedily enough recouped. In view, however, of
the uncertain and <ins class="corr" id="tn-135a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'oftentimes harrassing'">
oftentimes harassing</ins> conditions—not to
speak of the pecuniary loss—under which the riveting
department of shipbuilding work is conducted in the ordinary
way, shipbuilders are constrained to acknowledge the economic
advantages of the hydraulic system. Neither expense nor
trouble have been spared in several yards to extend the
hydraulic system into every feature where hydraulic work is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
practicable. The only feature now for which the machines presently
in use are not available is the shell plating, and perhaps
the decks, where such are entirely laid with plates. Indeed,
it may fairly be said that hydraulic riveters have virtually
supplanted manual riveting in nine-tenths of the structural
features of a vessel. The percentage of rivets closed by
machinery to the total number of rivets employed in a vessel’s
structure has been computed to be about fifty per cent. In
one of the yards fitted with the Tweddell system the following
comprise the list of structural features for which the hydraulic
riveters are daily employed:—Double bottom, including the
thousands of detached pieces of plates and angles of which
the bracket floor style of bottom is composed; side bars
attaching frames to double bottom, frames and reverse frames,
beams, stiffening bars, gunwale bars, keelsons, and keels.</p>

<p>The shell plating, as has already been said, is about the
only feature for which inventors and manufacturers of hydraulic
riveters have now any serious difficulty in making provision.
But many minds are exercised with the problem, and doubtless
at no very distant date the present obstacles will be
surmounted. One aspect of the question—and one which
certain classes are apt to overlook—is that which regards the
<em>mutual</em> adaptation of means to the end desired. Shipbuilders
have often under consideration the practicability of so modifying
structural features and methods of work as that inventors
of mechanical riveters will be met half-way in supplying the
much-felt desideratum. Referring to this subject, Mr Henry
H. West, chief surveyor to the Underwriters Registry for Iron
Vessels, in a paper on “Riveting of Iron Ships,” read before
the Institution of Naval Architects at its last meeting, said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“May I urge upon shipbuilders the importance of endeavouring to extend
the application of power riveting to the shell plating of iron vessels. By this
means we shall both increase the frictional resistance, and also, by more completely
filling the rivet holes, vastly improve the rigidity of the riveted joints.
The difficulty of completely and exactly filling the counter-sink of a counter-sunk
hole with a machine-closed rivet suggested to my friend Mr Kirk the idea of
entering the rivet from the outside, both the rivet and the counter-sink being
<ins class="corr" id="tn-136" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'made to guage'">
made to gauge</ins>, and then closing up with a machine snap-point on the inside of
the ship. What progress he has made in this direction I do not know, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
difficulty does not appear to be an insuperable one. If however, we are prepared
to sacrifice a fair appearance to utilitarian simplicity, there seems no
sufficient reason why, above water, all the rivets should not be closed up with
snap heads and points, both inside and outside. In whatever way it is accomplished,
I look to the use of machine riveting as one very great step in advance
in the future improvement of the riveted joints of iron ships; and if the
weight of iron vessels is to be reduced in any important degree, or if the
dimensions and proportions of large merchant steamers are to increase in the
future as they have done in the past, I feel sure that one of the first steps must
be the reconsideration of our butt fastenings.”</p>
</div>

<p>The increased engine power now demanded in steamships
undoubtedly points to the further adoption of mechanical
riveting—if vessels are to successfully withstand the enormous
strain and vibrations to which they are thereby subject.
While several have already shown drawings of the shell
difficulty having been met, Mr Tweddell, whose experience
in common with that of his manufacturers and co-patentees,
Messrs Fielding &amp; Platt, of Gloucester, may justly be considered
greatest in this branch of engineering, has never
illustrated this. It may be mentioned, however, that excellent
flush riveting is constantly done by the Tweddell
hydraulic riveters, and that the same plan suggested by Mr
Kirk of entering rivets with prepared counter-sunk heads
from one side, and snap pointing them by machine on the
other has been long in use by Messrs Fielding &amp; Platt. In
conjunction with Mr Tweddell, this firm have also designed
several efficient arrangements to ensure the machine being
kept in position until the unfinished head of the rivet is
formed. Judging from these facts, there seems good reason to
hope that the production of riveting machines required to
overtake the remaining features will not be very long delayed.</p>

<p>To show that where the exigencies of the times
<ins class="corr" id="tn-137" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'necesitate them'">
necessitate them</ins>, expedients involving inventive skill and industrial
intrepidity are never quite wanting, it may be
related that several years ago, during a prolonged strike of
riveters, the principal of the firm of Messrs A. M‘Millan &amp;
Son, Dumbarton, introduced a portable riveting machine for
the shells of ships. The machine, although improvised, as it
were, to meet an emergency, fulfilled all that was expected of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
it, and won the approval of Lloyd’s Surveyors for the Clyde
district, as well as of a special deputation selected by the Committee
of Lloyd’s in London from among the chief surveyors
of the United Kingdom. Their verdict on the performances
of the machine after due inspection was that it “thoroughly
fills the holes and countersinks, and produces a smoother and
better clench than can usually be obtained by hand labour.”
From this it will be seen that in the yard of Messrs M‘Millan
the matter of machine riveting has received early and earnest
consideration. Indeed, the extent to which hydraulic riveting
is presently employed by this firm so well represents the
development and progress made in this direction throughout
other yards that the system adopted in their establishment
may be described somewhat in detail.</p>

<p>The hydraulic plant and numerous different classes of portable
riveters are on the Tweddell system. The hydraulic
power required to work the various machines is furnished by
a pair of vertical steam engines, geared to a set of two-throw
pumps, which force the water at a pressure of 1,500-lb. per
square inch into an accumulator. This latter feature, as is
well known, serves to store up the power in a considerable
amount ready to meet the sudden demands of one or more of
the riveters without calling on the pumps. As is the case in
all machinery on this system, the accumulator is loaded to a
pressure of 1,500-lb. per square inch. The means employed for
the transmission of the water-power, from the service of main
pipes laid as required throughout the yard, are flexible copper
pipes, admitting of being led almost in any direction, however
irregular, without being impaired or rendered inefficient.
When the plant was laid down about four years ago, Messrs
M‘Millan determined to err if anything on the side of
prudence, and they laid all their mains of double the required
size, so that they could, if the high pressure was found objectionable,
return to the lower pressures sometimes employed;
they have, however, never found it advisable to do so.</p>

<p>In this yard can be seen portable riveters suspended over a
vessel’s deck between 40 and 50 feet above ground, capable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
reaching and clenching rivets in stringers at a distance of 4 feet
6 inches from edge of plate. The power brought into play in
closing some of these rivets is very great—from 20 to 30 tons—and
yet this is conveyed by a small tube of only half-inch
outside diameter in some cases through a distance of many
hundred feet. The portable riveter here indicated is suspended
on a light and handy carriage, which can travel the
upper deck from stem to stern, being made purposely low so
as to clear poop and bridge deck beams if such should be
fitted. With this machine Messrs M‘Millan have closed from
400 to 450 rivets per day of nine hours in stringers 3 feet 6
inches wide. They have also effected some very heavy work
in attaching the sheer strake to the gunwale bar, the rate of
progress being correspondingly satisfactory. The same features
in the <i>Alaska</i>, built by Messrs John Elder &amp; Co., were similarly
operated upon by another of Mr Tweddell’s riveters, whose
complete system has been adopted in this large establishment
also. By an elongation of the suspending arm Messrs M‘Millan
hope to execute, besides the stringers, most of the deck work,
such as ties, diagonals, hatch coamings, &amp;c., in one traverse
of the carriage. Moreover, a second carriage with riveter
may be doing simultaneously the same work on the other side
of the vessel. Indeed, it only requires a further development
of such work to make the riveting of complete iron decks
practicable, and—with the rate of wages, for hand riveted
work, usually prevailing—profitable also.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">TWEDDELL PORTABLE FRAME AND BEAM RIVETER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The riveting of the frames and beams is the simplest of all
the work overtaken by the hydraulic riveters, and it is here
the system is seen to most advantage. In any yard furnished
with these machines rivets are closed at a greatly accelerated
rate compared with work done by hand. Tweddell machines
have been known to close, in beams, 1,800 to 1,900 rivets per
machine per day of 9½ hours. In frames the average rate at
which rivets are closed is about 1,400 per day. The cost for
this section of riveted work has been computed to be
about one-half of that by hand, and the quality of the
work is everywhere acknowledged to be better. With the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
same number of men the work is accomplished in something
like one-third of the time. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> in overtaking
this feature of the work may be briefly described. For the riveting
of the frames, in almost every case, two cranes of any
convenient construction are fixed at the head of the berth in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
which the vessel is to be built; the frames are laid across the
keel as in hand work, and rest on trestles, where the portable
riveter, carried on the before-mentioned cranes, rivets them
up. As the riveting in each frame is completed it is drawn
down the keel by steam or hand power, and set up in place.
The riveting of the beams is a still more simple operation,
the beam to be riveted being placed under a gantry somewhat
longer than the beam itself, and upon which the portable
riveter travels. The suspending gear in this and other of the
Tweddell machines combines the functions of hydraulic lifts
for raising or lowering the riveter, and of conveying the
necessary hydraulic pressure to the riveter. The beam is
supported on trestles, and the riveter, having the facilities
for travel and exact adjustment just described, accomplishes
the surprising work before mentioned.</p>

<p>The conditions under which the riveting in cellular and
bracket bottoms is accomplished are less favourable to expeditious
work. This system of ship’s bottom is greatly more
complex in its constructive features than the ordinary bottom.
The separate plates and angles which go to form the bracket
floor system are to be numbered—in vessels of the average
size—by thousands. The frames in such vessels are formed
of three parts; one part stretches across the bottom and abuts
against the plates forming the sides of the cellular bottom; the
other two parts form the sides of the vessel, but are not erected
until the bottom portions of the frames have been laid and all
the bracket and longitudinal girders are erected and fitted
upon them. On the bottom, as thus described, the portable
riveters are required to operate, in many instances having
to reach the rivets at a distance of 4 feet 6 inches from the
edge of the plates, and in confined spaces of 24 inches. When
the frames and beams are completely riveted and beginning
to be erected, a travelling-crane (in Messrs M‘Millan’s two
travelling cranes are employed working from separate ends of
the vessel) carrying a large portable riveter, is placed on the
top of the floors, with short lengths of planking laid to act as
tramways. The perfect control thus obtained is somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
extraordinary. The crane jib has sufficient rake to command
the whole floor of the ship, and every rivet can be closed in
the confined spaces already described. Some 800 rivets per
day can be put in, many of them at a distance of 4 feet 6 ins.
from the edge of the plate. The quality of the work is all
that could be desired; in some parts, indeed, the use of the
felt-packing necessary in hand work has been found to be
unnecessary owing to the tight work obtained by hydraulic
riveting. One crane with its riveting machine can, in a
vessel of moderate size, say 3,000 to 4,000 tons, fully keep
pace with the up-ending of the frames, provided it has something
of a start. As it advances the lower deck beams are
put in place behind it, and the other work follows in order.
In ships of the more ordinary construction, longitudinal keelsons
are fitted, which are readily reached by special portable
riveters, suspended by means of neat devices, some of them the
ideas or suggestions of workmen in Messrs M‘Millan’s service.</p>

<p>The only machine of the series of portable riveters employed
by Messrs M‘Millan which remains to be noticed is that which
overtakes the riveting of keels. This machine is perhaps one
of the most perfect of the series, performing its functions
satisfactorily, viewed from whatever standpoint. The riveting
required on the keel of large vessels is very heavy, especially
if the through-keelson and side-bar system is adopted, when
five thicknesses of plate have to be connected, the rivets
employed being 1⅛-inch or 1¼-inch in diameter. The situation
is not favourable for getting at the work to be done, the head-room
available not often exceeding 2½ or 3 feet. These
conditions render great compactness, together with portableness,
necessary in the machine. The keel itself was utilised
for the attachment of the Tweddell riveter as first tried,
then again a sort of light trestle was employed, the riveter
being at one end of a lever racking on this. These plans were
abandoned, however, in favour of the machine as now used in
various yards throughout the country, an illustration of
which is given by Fig. 23. A low carriage is travelled
down alongside the keel. This carriage supports a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
balanced lever, carrying at one end the riveter, capable of
exerting about 50 tons on the rivet head, and at the other a
balance weight. This lever can in its turn revolve horizontally
about a short pillar fixed on a turn-table, thus affording
unlimited control over the riveter by the man in charge;
enabling him, indeed, to adjust the riveter to every irregularity
of position or direction of the rivets in keel. As many
as 420 1¼-inch rivets per day have been put in by this machine,
an amount which is fully equal to the work of two squads of
riveters, and in one yard 70 rivets have been closed in as
many consecutive minutes.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig23" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <span class="fs80">FIG. 23.</span>
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig23.jpg" alt="Machine for inserting keel rivets">
  <figcaption class="caption">TWEDDELL HYDRAULIC KEEL RIVETER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It may be stated generally that the several hydraulic
riveters require two men to work them, and the rivets are
heated in portable furnaces and dealt out in any quantities
required, by a boy in attendance. The quality of the work
done is superior to hand work, chiefly in that when rivets are
well heated the pressure is equalised, and affects the rivets
throughout their entire length, filling the holes to their utmost.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
This advantage tells more in the case of keel riveting, and
that it is so is evidenced by the fact, as communicated by a
foreman having great experience, that rivets ¼-inch longer than
rivets closed by hand have even less superfluous surface
material when closed by the machine.</p>

<p>From the facts above detailed, taken in conjunction with
the opinions of such authorities as Mr West, it can fairly be
claimed for Mr Tweddell as the inventor of the earliest of the
hydraulic riveters now so extensively employed in shipyards,
that he has greatly improved the character of work in ship construction.
Not only so, but he has relieved the shipyard artizan
from a species of work which requires little or no skill in its
execution—work, indeed, which may properly be relegated
to, as it certainly in course of time will be included in, that
vast domain in which water, steam, electricity, and the other
natural powers are so wondrously made to play their part.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>While the extended use of improved machinery has brought
about changes in the iron-working departments of shipyards
that are structurally of the greatest importance, it is nevertheless
true that the largest acquisition to shipyard machinery of
late has been made in the wood-working departments. It is
here, beyond question, where the equipment of modern shipyards
is seen to be so much an advance on the former order
of things, when handicraft was indispensable and paramount;
and it is also here, probably, where the greatest labour-saving
advances have been made. The artistic perfection which is
evinced in the palatial saloons and state-rooms of many modern
steamships would not have been possible—commercially so, at
least—to the shipbuilders of twenty years ago, whose appliances,
regarded from present-day standpoints, seem to have been woefully
crude and meagre. Still, it is not by any means to be
understood that all the shipyards of to-day are alike commentaries
on the former state of things, because even now there
are not wanting yards in which the necessary wood-work for
ships is accomplished with singularly few machines. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
need for accessions in this direction, however, is being more
keenly felt every day, and in many yards quite recently the
entire joinery department has been thoroughly re-organised
and equipped. The chapter which follows will be devoted to
descriptions of some representative establishments in the
several districts, and as special references may therein be made
to the machinery equipment of the wood-working departments,
the present remarks will only be of a general nature.</p>

<p>The conversion of wood from the absolutely rough state into
finished and finely-surfaced material, ready for immediate use
in the interior of vessels, forms at the present time not an
uncommon portion of the daily work in shipyards well equipped
with modern machinery. This is not only concerned with the
commoner woods employed in large quantities for structural
purposes, but also to a considerable extent with those various
ornamental hardwoods entering into the decorative features.
The change of which this is indicative is one of increased self-dependence
and economy formerly not dreamed of in shipyards,
and of improvements at every stage in the machinery
for wood conversion, which are simply wonderful. In circular
and straight saws, planing, moulding, and shaping machines,
band and fret-saw machines, mortising, tenoning, and dove-tailing
machines, and in machines for scraping, sand-papering,
and miscellaneous purposes, not a few modern shipyards reflect
the fullest engineering progress as concerned with wood-working
machinery. In planing machines especially are the
labour-saving advantages made apparent. As illustrating this
it may be explained that machines of this kind in daily use
are able to plane a greatly increased breadth of surface, to work
several sides of the wood at one operation, and at a marvellously
accelerated speed as compared with hand work. Similarly, as
regards the formation of mouldings, it may be stated that a
moulding which would take a competent workman some hours
to produce can be completed on a good machine in less than
<em>one minute</em>. Many patterns of mouldings and other decorative
items now largely used are thus only possible—commercially
if not otherwise—through the extended employment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
machinery. The degree of “finish” now put upon the plainest
features—rendered pecuniarly possible by the use of machinery—is
nowhere so striking as in the scraping of panels and the
sand-papering of large surfaces. In one shipyard the author
has witnessed the scraping of hardwood panels as broad as
30-ins., the shaving taken off being of marvellous thinness
and perfectly uniform and entire throughout the length and
breadth of panel. The surface left on the panel is beautifully
smooth, rendering any after-dressing with sand paper superfluous,
and the shavings have all the appearance and much
of the flexibility of fine paper. In many other ways that
might be instanced, the improvement in machinery is not less
striking, but what has already been given may sufficiently
illustrate the general advance.</p>

<p>The sources from which modern wood-working machinery
is obtained are various. Notable firms of machinists throughout
this country, in America, and on the Continent, are
drawn upon, each of whom, although not furnishing complete
installations of wood-working machinery, are distinguished for
some “special make” of one or other of the machines necessary.
In the plentitude of firms whose names suggest themselves in
this connection, it may be invidious to single out any for
special mention, yet, of firms in this country, Messrs M‘Dowall
&amp; Sons, of Johnstone, and Messrs T. Robinson &amp; Son, Rochdale;
and of firms in America, Messrs J. A. Fay &amp; Co., of
Cincinnati, may be noticed as having furnished many machines
which are highly valued in shipyards.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the recent advancement in this direction,
there is still scope for improved wood-working machinery, and
for machines to overtake additional work in shipyards. A
single, though perhaps not particularly striking, instance may
be given. While attempts have been made to supply it, there
is not yet, so far as the author knows, a machine for planing
decks after the planking has been laid, and the seams caulked
and payed. Those acquaint with the laborious and unskilled
nature of the work to be done, will readily concede the fitness
of applying, if possible, mechanical means to achieve it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Attention may here be directed to the subject of improvements
in shipyard machines and methods of work, directly due
to the careful study of results from every-day practice.
Workmen themselves have too seldom been instrumental in
effecting such improvements, although in many respects the
most fitting mediums through which improvements could
come. A lingering antipathy to new machinery on the
score of its supplanting hand work, and perhaps the want
of proper knowledge of scientific principles, have prevented
many from taking part in this way. To encourage the exercise
of the inventive faculty amongst workmen, as well as to reap
personal advantage, Messrs Denny &amp; Brothers instituted in
1880 a scheme of rewards for invention in their establishment,
which has been attended with gratifying success, and has
since been copied in other quarters. Particulars of this scheme
will be given in the following chapter, thus making detailed
reference here unnecessary. It may be said briefly, however,
that awards ranging from £12 to £3 are paid to workmen who
submit inventions, and when any one has been successful in
obtaining five awards he receives a premium of £20, and when
he has obtained ten awards he is paid a further premium of
£25—the premiums increasing by £5 for every additional
five awards received. During the time it has been in vogue as
many as 200 claims have been entered, over 110 of which have
received awards, representing in all the disbursement by the
firm of about £500. The majority of the awards made have
been concerned with improvements in the joinery departments.
Some of the machines there have been modified or altered so
as to do twice the quantity of work previously possible, some
to do a new class of work, and others to do the same work with
greater safety, and with less wear and tear.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In several other sections of shipyard work, progress is
strikingly evinced. Of these it may suffice to instance the
work of transport between one shop and another, and between
workshops and building berths, also that of lifting heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
weights either by stationery or locomotive cranes. Means of
effecting such work are now employed in many yards, which,
viewed in the light of former things, are truly prodigious.</p>

<p>The increasing propulsive power with which steamships are
being fitted necessitates ponderous weights in connection with
the engines and boilers. The means available for lifting such
weights have not until within recent years been possessed by
private shipbuilders, but have been the property of public bodies,
such as Harbour Trusts. The majority of shipbuilders have still
to depend on such outside aid, but within the past few years
several large firms—particularly on the Clyde—who have the
necessary dock accommodation, have erected in connection
with their works enormous “sheer-legs;” the modern equivalent
for cranes, which are now somewhat out of fashion for ponderous
work. Some of these are amongst the most powerful
ever erected, being capable of lifting 80, 100, and even 120
tons weight. Such enormous appliances, it may readily be
understood, enables the firm possessing them to be independent
of extraneous assistance, and to complete in every respect
within their own establishments vessels of the largest class.</p>

<p>The means of transporting material in shipyards by systems
of railways laid alongside the principal workshops, and traversing
the yard in all directions, have been amplified and improved
in many yards within recent times. Connection is made in
most instances with sidings from main lines of railway, whereby
materials and goods can be at once brought into the yards from
whatever part of the kingdom; and in the largest yards special
locomotives are constantly employed doing this work. In well
arranged establishments the railway first enters a store-yard,
and the material is lifted from the trucks by travelling-crane
or other means, and deposited on either side of the
railway, plates being set on edge in special racks, from which
they can be easily removed by the workmen. Leaving this,
the lines of railway traverse the building yard throughout, and
are designed to permit of the material being conveyed without
retrocession, but with the necessary stoppages for its
being put through the various courses of manipulation, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
vessel in which it is to be used. A recent and very serviceable
amplification of the system of railway transport has been
fitted in one of the largest Clyde yards which enables material
to be conveyed with greatly increased ease and despatch in
directions and to situations wholly inaccessible to the main
lines of rails. This is the narrow gauge portable system,
patented by M. Decauville, of Petit-Bourg, Paris, which consists
of short lengths of very light steel rails, permanently riveted to
cross sleepers, and with end connections so formed as to make
joint while being pressed into contact. Each section, of 4, 6,
8, 12, or 16 feet long, being complete in itself, the tramway
can be laid down in any new situation very rapidly. Where
divergences of route take place, curves, crossings, and light
turntables are supplied, sufficiently strong to carry working
loads, and at the same time light enough to be easily handled.
Special waggons and trollies are also supplied by the makers,
which, combined with the system of portable rails described,
not only worthily take the place of, but far excel in handiness
and efficiency, the ordinary wheel-barrows of the shipyard.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Although in the preceding chapter the main directions
in which progress with respect to shipyard appliances
and methods of work have been outlined, the record necessarily
fails to cover many minor matters which are still essential to an
appreciative view of modern shipbuilding. This want cannot
better be supplied than by giving detailed descriptions of some
representative shipyards and engineering works throughout the
principal centres. The establishments which will be selected
for notice are amongst the largest in the several districts, and
on the whole represent almost all that is advanced in the
shipbuilding industry, while to most of them a special interest
attaches through the many high-class vessels produced from
their stocks for the better-known shipping lines. On such
grounds it is hoped the intelligent reader will find the choice
of yards—where there was no alternative but to choose—justified
and fitting. Three Clyde shipyards, two on the Tyne,
one on the Wear, and one at Barrow-in-Furness, will be
described. The accounts are written from authoritative information
specially supplied, aided and verified by personal
knowledge of the works dealt with, and are chiefly concerned
with the capability and arrangement of the several yards. Other
matters of a more technical nature, such as the comparison of
methods of work in the several districts,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> are not dealt with. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
some extent this still differs in individual yards, but modern
practice is being more assimilated throughout the districts as
time goes on. The first establishment dealt with will be:—</p>

MESSRS JOHN ELDER &amp; CO.’S<br>
SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING WORKS,<br>
FAIRFIELD, GOVAN, NEAR GLASGOW.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The progress of shipbuilding and marine engineering on the Clyde
may be said to include several more or less well-defined periods or
stages, and the student of industrial progress must feel bound to
connect with these the name of the late John Elder, a distinguished
leader in these important industries, and an engineer whose improvements
in the marine engine deserve to rank alongside those
improvements which James Watt effected in his day. In 1852 Mr
Elder joined his friend, Mr Randolph, in an established business,
and shortly afterwards made preparations to add marine engineering
to the mill-wright and other businesses of the firm. The new firm
speedily established itself through a series of improvements, having
for their object the reduction of fuel consumption on board steam
vessels. In 1860 the firm commenced to build ships, and as shipbuilders
and marine engineers they laboured successfully for sixteen
years, building during that period 106 vessels, with an aggregate
tonnage of 81,326 tons, and constructing 111 sets of marine engines,
showing a nominal power of 20,145 horses. At this time the
co-partnery contract expired, and Mr John Elder took over the
entire works, carrying them on with great success until his death,
which occurred in London in September, 1869, when at the
early age of 45 years. After his death the business of the firm
was taken up by Mr John F. Ure, Mr J. L. K. Jamieson, and Mr
William Pearce, all of whom had previously achieved distinction in
shipbuilding and engineering, and the efforts of these gentlemen far
exceeded the success of Mr John Elder’s first firm. In 16 years, as
above stated, the latter launched 106 vessels of an aggregate tonnage
of 81,326 tons, and constructed 111 sets of marine engines of 20,145
nominal horse-power, whereas the new firm launched in nine years
97 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 192,355 tons, and constructed
90 sets of marine engines of 31,193 nominal horse-power. About
six years ago Mr Ure and Mr Jamieson retired from the firm,
leaving Mr Pearce sole partner, and during these six years the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
activity and enterprise formerly characterising the firm have been
worthily sustained, and the firm has kept in the very front rank.
In maintaining this position, and achieving unprecedented results in
the matter of swift steamships, not a little credit is due to Mr A. D.
Bryce-Douglas, an engineer of well-attested skill, who wields the
sceptre of authority in the engineering section.</p>

<p>The works, which are situated on the south bank of the Clyde at
Fairfield, near Govan, occupy an area of about 70 acres, and comprise
shipyard, boiler shop, engine works, and tidal basin. The
disposition of the various workshops is admirable, and as these are
connected with each other by a broad gauge line of rails communicating
with all parts of the yard and the terminus of the Govan
railway, the conveyance of raw material in the first instance, its
location in whatever section of the works it may be specially
designed for, and its transmission in the form of finished items of
structure or outfit to the vessels of which it is to form part, are all
accomplished with ease.</p>

<p>Entering by the south-east gate, the visitor proceeds in the direction
of the business offices, his first impression probably being one
of wonder at the immense quantities of iron and steel in plates and
bars covering every available piece of ground, as well as the great
quantity of timber of all dimensions stacked and in racks, maturing
for after use. Arriving at the offices of the firm, the visitor is
probably first ushered into the draughtsmen’s rooms, which, as well
as a large reception-room, contain an extensive collection of models
of the vessels that have been constructed by the firm. In these
apartments a large staff of draughtsmen are employed in the work
of designing new vessels, and making working drawings of ships
already contracted for.</p>

<p>Following the routine of practical operations the visitor is conducted
to the moulding loft, which is 320 feet long by 50 feet wide.
Here the drawings of the vessels are put down full size. The term
“laying off” is applied to the operation of transferring to the mould
loft-floor those designs and general proportions of a ship which have
been drawn on paper, and from which all the preliminary calculations
have been made and the form decided. The lines of the ship
and exact representations of many of the parts of which it is composed
are delineated here to their actual or real dimensions, in order
that moulds or skeleton outlines may be made from them for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
guidance of the workmen. These lines, when completed and carefully
verified, are afterwards transferred to scrieve boards, from
which the frames, floors, &amp;c., are bent. In connection with the
moulding loft is a pattern shop, in which the various moulds required
in “laying off” are made.</p>

<p>Descending to the iron-work machine shop, which measures about
1000 feet long by 150 feet wide, a scene of great activity meets the
eye. Proceeding to that section where the bending blocks are situated,
the operation of forming the frames of a vessel may be noticed. The
bending blocks are massive iron plates weighing several tons, on
which the form of the frame is marked from the scrieve boards. All
over the blocks are round holes, closely spaced and equidistant, in
which iron pins are placed to give the form of the frame to be bent.
Long bars of angle-iron, properly heated in adjacent furnaces, are
brought by the workmen to the blocks, and there the bars are
bent round the pins to the form required. The half frame of a ship
is thus fashioned to the proper form in little more time than it takes
to describe the process. It is now allowed to cool, and it is then
returned to the scrieve boards to be set or adjusted with the reverse
frame, which with the floor plate go to make the frame in its finished
form. While this is going on, the keel blocks are being laid in the
usual manner on the building slip, and the keel, stem, and stern-posts
are being forged and drilled. The keel is laid, and the frames
are then set up in their places, and are kept in position by shores
and ribbon pieces. The stem and stern-posts are then set up, and
the work now becomes general all over the vessel. The beams
previously made are put up, the bulkheads, stringer plates, and
keelsons are added in due succession, and the outside shell is being
fitted and riveted. Thus the full and perfect form of the vessel
is gradually developed, and exhibits one of the most interesting and
useful productions of man’s labour. In the bending shop alluded to
are several large Gorman furnaces, 25 smithy fires for heating angle
irons, several sets of plate-bending rolls, five stands of vertical
drilling machines with several spindles each, a huge punching
machine capable of producing ten rivet holes at each operation,
squeezers, boring, planing, counter-sinking, plate-bending, plate
planing, numerous punching and shearing machines, and other
appliances. The motive power of this section is supplied by a
powerful set of engines lately erected by the firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Immediately to the front of this building are the slips, which
extend 1,200 feet along the Clyde, and admit of 12 to 14 vessels
being proceeded with at one time. While proceeding among the
slips hydraulic riveters may be observed at work on several structural
features. The attention given to such machines in the
preceding chapter makes further notice here unnecessary.</p>

<p>When a steamship leaves the ways she is towed into the firm’s
tidal dock to receive the boilers and machinery. With the
assistance of a pair of 80-ton sheer-legs, Messrs Elder &amp; Co. are
able to complete this part of the construction of a vessel with wonderful
despatch. In connection with this section is a smithy and
small mechanics’ shop, which are alongside of the wharf. Space
will not permit a description of the smiths’ shop, the paint shop,
riggers’ loft, plumbers’ shop, belt-makers’ shop, boat-builders’ shop,
block and pattern-makers’ shop, pattern store, general store, &amp;c.,
about each of which much of interest might be written.</p>

<p>The wood-working department, though stocked with the most
approved labour-saving appliances, still affords employment to several
hundreds of hands. In the saw mill, which is about 100 feet square,
there are several sets of steam saw frames, circular saws, planing
machines for operating on deck planks, and other tools, the producing
capacity of which is very large. Adjacent to this is the
spar shed, where all the spars required on board the vessels are made.</p>

<p>In the joiners’ shops are numerous wood-working machines, which
are placed advantageously all through this department, comprising
planing, morticing, and moulding machines, circular and fret saws,
surface planing and jointing machines, general joiners, lathes, and
a variety of other tools from the most noted makers of this class of
mechanism. The cabinetmaker’s shop is a spacious one, and here
the finer class of interior fittings are seen in all stages of progress.
Nothing in this section seems omitted in the way of mechanical
appliances to afford the utmost facility for rapid production and
excellence of workmanship.</p>

<p>The marine engineering department of the business is conducted
in an imposing pile of buildings about 300 feet square.
This immense shop is 50 feet high, and is divided into four
bays, or compartments, by three spacious galleries of two floors,
each 30 feet wide, and extending the entire length of the building.
These galleries serve the double purpose of supporting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
powerful travelling cranes (two of which are capable of lifting
loads of 40 tons, and the other two lesser weights), and providing
convenient retreats where boilermaking, copperwork, and other
operations are conducted. It is doubtful if a similar collection of
ponderous tools is to be found anywhere else in Great Britain.
Notable among the heavy tools seen here in operation is one of
enormous proportions for planing and trimming armour plates, being
capable of smoothing a surface 20 feet by 6 feet. There are three
self-acting screw-cutting lathes, two slotting machines of great
power, a universal radial drilling machine, with a radius of 18 feet,
capable of boring a hole 4 inches in diameter, through a 9 inch plate
in half-an-hour; a turning lathe having a 10-ft. spindle with a
diameter of 20-ins.; a planing machine which cuts either horizontally
or vertically, and has a traverse of 15 feet by 12 feet; two
vertical boring machines, each with a travel of 5 feet; a turning
lathe 8½ feet in diameter, with a 34 feet shaft; and a terrible and
mysterious-looking machine, with a metallic disc 18 feet in diameter,
armed with powerful steel cutters fixed round its circumference,
which takes a shaving of 2½ inches off the mass of iron upon which
it is operating. This machine was the invention of the late Mr
Elder’s father, and is one of the most wonderful tools in existence.
Adjoining this engine shop is the forge, which, with its 50 fires, 16
steam hammers, and all the necessary appurtenances to produce
forgings with despatch, is an exceedingly busy section of the works.
It is 300 feet long and 100 feet wide; and being lofty, excellent
ventilation is obtained.</p>

<p>There are three smithies of large dimensions—one being retained
for heavy work, and the others for light work. In connection with
the engine shop is a pattern shop which, like all the other wood-working
departments of the premises, is fully provided with tools
having the most modern improvements. The brass foundry is well
appointed, and is arranged in two sections—one for light, and the
other for heavy work. Manganese bronze propellers, of which the
firm make a speciality, are made here in great numbers; the monthly
output of this department amounts to 45 tons, all of which is used
up in the yard, with the exception of a number of propellers which
the firm supply to other shipbuilders.</p>

<p>The capabilities of the Fairfield establishment, it may readily be
believed, are of the highest order. Scarcely anything need be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
in substantiation of this, as the past few years have witnessed the
continuous production from its stocks of very many steamships of
the highest class, whose names have already become “household
words.” Of these it may be sufficient to instance the <i>Arizona</i>, the
<i>Alaska</i>, the <i>Austral</i>, the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, and the <i>Oregon</i>. Apart
from these, and perhaps no less worthy examples of Fairfield work,
vessels of war have been turned out to a goodly extent, as well as
vessels for a great variety of trades, but it is for the fast mail and
passenger steamships that the establishment is chiefly famed. Its
reputation in this respect bids fair to be augmented by the production
of the two powerful Cunard steamers already referred to in this
work, and which are now nearing completion.</p>

<p>The following tabulated form shows the amount of tonnage built,
and the horse-power of engines fitted, by Messrs Elder &amp; Co. during
the past fourteen years:—</p>

<p>During ordinarily busy periods the number of operatives employed
by Messrs Elder &amp; Co. reaches six thousand. The united earnings
of this great army of workmen amount to over £33,000 per month.
As a further indication of the stupendousness of the works, it may
be mentioned that on board a single vessel—the <i>Umbria</i>—as many
as 1,200 workmen have been employed at one time. The supervision
of affairs in this great establishment is, as may readily be
understood, a matter necessitating numerous “heads,” “sub-heads,”
and departments. The general manager in the shipyard is Mr J.
W. Shepherd, a naval architect of well-approved ability.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">MESSRS WILLIAM DENNY &amp; BROTHERS’ LEVEN SHIPYARD,<br>DUMBARTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The firm of William Denny &amp; Brothers, Dumbarton, began the
business of iron shipbuilding in the year 1844, in a small yard
situated on the east bank of the river Leven. To this they subsequently
added the “Woodyard” on the opposite side of the river,
which had been occupied for a considerable period by William
Denny the elder, builder of the “Marjory,” “Rob Roy,” and many
other notable craft, during the infancy of steam navigation. The
composition of the firm at the outset comprised William, Alexander,
and Peter, sons of the builder of the “Marjory,” but it was
augmented after a time by the assumption of two other brothers,
James and Archibald. The co-partnery some time after again underwent
change when the two brothers Alexander and Archibald seceded,
and formed small yards of their own. In 1854 the firm sustained
an almost irreparable loss in the death of William, the original promoter
of the concern, to whose energy and surpassing skill most of
the success then attained was due. His decease was deeply
lamented, not only as an irreparable family bereavement, but as a
public loss. When he first devoted his energies to the formation
of an iron shipbuilding concern, it was at a time of great industrial
gloom in the community. With its successful establishment began
a brighter era in the industrial and social history of the burgh—one
which has never once been seriously interrupted, and seems only
now to be approaching the “high noon” of its prosperity. Sometime
subsequent to the decease of William, the co-partnery was
further reduced through the death of James. For a considerable
time thereafter the business was carried on by Peter alone, until in
1868 he was joined by his eldest son William, and 1871 by Mr Walter
Brock—co-partner in the firm of Denny &amp; Coy.: a distinct marine
engineering business established by Peter Denny and others in
1851. Within the past three years farther accessions to the firm
have been made in Mr James Denny, son of James of the original
firm, and in Messrs Peter Denny, John M. Denny, and Archibald
Denny, sons of Peter, and younger brothers of William, who for
some time has been managing partner of the shipbuilding firm, as
Mr Brock is of the engine works.</p>

<p>In 1867 the firm transferred their establishment to the present
site on the east bank of the river Leven near its confluence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
with the Clyde, and under the shadow of the Castle-rock, which
figures largely, alike in the scenic renown and the historic annals of
Scotland. Through a most elaborate series of extensions and
improvements carried out within the past two-and-a-half years, the
works have been enlarged to more than double their previous
dimensions, and correspondingly increased in working capability.
They occupy a total area of forty-three acres, over five acres of which
are taken up with wet dock accommodation, and as much as seven-and-a-half
acres with workshops, sheds, and roofed spaces of various
kinds. The yard has a most advantageous and extensive frontage
to the Leven, which, under the provisions of a recently obtained
Harbour Act, is being greatly improved as regards width and deepening.
The principal launching berths, eight in number, are ranged
about the centre portion of the yard’s length, and their projections
into the river Leven, favoured by a bend at this part, are almost in
the direct line of its course. Through the recent improvements,
these berths are capable of receiving vessels of dimensions and tonnage
such as the present race for big ships has not even approached.
The arrangement permits of eight vessels being built of lengths
ranging gradually from a maximum of 750 feet downwards. Besides
these principal berths, there are spaces near the south end of the
yard, where light-draught paddle-steamers and the smaller class of
screw vessels are constructed and launched, or taken to pieces and
shipped abroad. All the work of construction, fitting out, and
putting machinery on board ship, is accomplished within the yard
gates. Contributing to this result are two tidal docks, one newly
formed, of over four acres in extent, and another of over an acre.
The bottom of the new dock is 26 feet below the level of the yard
and wharfage, affording at high tide 20 feet of water. In connection
with the dock, powerful sheer-legs are being erected by Messrs Day
&amp; Summers, of Southampton, capable of lifting the enormous
weight of one hundred tons. Alongside of the smaller dock
are a pair of sheer-legs, capable of lifting 50 tons, with two subsidiary
cranes of 10 tons each. For all purposes, either of construction
or outfit of the largest vessel, these and the other enlarged
resources place the firm in a position of entire independence with
regard to extraneous accommodation or appliances. The engines
and boilers for Messrs Denny Brothers’ vessels are invariably supplied
by Messrs Denny &amp; Company, whose large works, greatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
extended within recent years, are situated further up the Leven.
Along the eastern boundary of the Leven Shipyard, for over
1000 feet of its length, the joiners’ shops, blacksmiths’ shops,
machine sheds, outfit stores, &amp;c., are ranged. The joiners’ shops
are most admirable for the completeness of their appointment.
They occupy the ground floor and first flat of a three-storey
building, 250 feet by 65 feet, forming part of the range spoken
of. The machines contained in these apartments are of the
newest and most approved description of both British and American
make, and embrace moulding, planing, mortising, tenoning, dove-tailing,
nibbling, scraping, and sand-papering machines; circular,
band, and cross-cut saws; also machines for decorative carving and
incising, &amp;c., the whole being driven by a special engine of considerable
power, located near the building. A large sawmill and
shed, containing various wood-working machines, are situate close
to the Leven, near the south end of the yard, and all the wood
employed in the yard is here cut from the rough. The blacksmiths’
and angle smiths’ shops and the machine sheds are correspondingly
well furnished with the most modern appliances. The
former of these contain over fifty fires, and ten steam hammers,
as well as verticals, lathes, &amp;c., conveniently situated. The latter are
splendidly equipped, containing several large plate rolls, planing
machines, beam-bending machines, and an assortment of multiple
drills and counter-sinking machines of the most modern type;
also a large number of punching and shearing machines, including
two man-hole punches capable of piercing 30 by 20-in. holes
in plates ¾-inch thick. The plate and frame furnace, bending
block, and scrive board accommodation throughout the yard, is of
extent commensurate with the other features above described, all
of which being of recent formation, are of the most approved and
modern description.</p>

<p>The system of railways throughout the shipyard is of an unusually
complete description. Connection is made with the main line
of the North British Railway, and enters the yard on its north
side, where a store-yard of about two acres affords ample storage
accommodation for material in steel and iron. Leaving this and
traversing the building yard throughout, the lines of railway are
designed to permit of material being conveyed without retrocession
to the vessel of which they are to form part, but with the stoppages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
necessary for their being put through the various courses of manipulation.
In addition, the yard is traversed in directions and to
situations inaccessible to the main lines of rails, by the narrow gauge
portable system, patented by M. Decauville, which is of great service.</p>

<p>A special department in the establishment of Messrs Denny, and
an entirely novel feature in a private shipyard, is the experimental
tank, already referred to in the Chapter on scientific progress. This
notable section of Messrs Denny’s works may be described as consisting
of a basin 300 feet long, 22 feet wide, and containing
9 feet of water over the principal portion of its length. Around
this basin are the shops and appliances for the work which has to
be done—constructive, experimental, and analytical. This work on
the constructive side consists of making paraffine models, which
represent on an appropriate scale the ships to which the experiments
have reference; the paraffine is melted, cast in a rough mould to
the approximate shape, and afterwards faired off by a specially-constructed
and very ingenious cutting machine. When finished the
model is passed on to the second stage—the experimental. A stationary
engine draws a carriage along a railway suspended above the water
space, the carriage is accompanied by the model, with an attachment
which allows the model to move freely, and at the same time
to depend entirely for its propelling force upon a spring carried by
the carriage. The extensions of this spring are measured and
recorded automatically, so too are the speeds, the record being made
by electric pens in the form of diagrams, on a revolving cylinder which
is part of the apparatus of the carriage. The analytical work consists
of obtaining from the diagrams the items of speed and propelling
force, the relation between which, at all speeds for which the
experiments have been made, is thus obtained. The facilities which
are offered by the tank for investigating to the utmost the laws of
hydrodynamics in so far as they affect, practically, the resistance of
ships, is thus obvious. On the facade of the tank, fronting the
public street, Messrs Denny have placed an admirably-sculptured
medallion portrait of the late Mr William Froude, of Torquay,
the noted experimentalist. Underneath is the following inscription:—“This
facade of the Leven Shipyard Experimental Tank
is erected in memory of the late William Froude, F.R.S., L.L.D.,
the greatest of experimenters and investigators of hydrodynamics.
Born 29th November, 1811. Died 14th May, 1879.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Telephonic communication having previously been established with
advantage between Leven Shipyard and the Engine Works of Messrs
Denny &amp; Co., towards the close of 1883 a telephone exchange system
was established in the shipyard, by which means twenty-six separate
places are in communication with one another. These are the residences
of the principal members of the firm, the manager’s house, the
Levenbank Foundry, the Dennystown Forge, four stations at the
Engine Works, and seventeen stations within the shipyard, representing
in all from six to seven miles of line wire. The electric light has
already been partially introduced into the shipyard, but steps have
been taken by the firm for further extending it to the various offices,
the experimental tank, the joiners’ shop, and the upholstery and
decorators’ rooms, as well as providing arc lamps of great power to
light up the area of the yard itself.</p>

<p>Besides the introduction of the electric light into their yard,
Messrs Denny have formed an electrical department in connection
with their works, which will not only be employed in arranging
and maintaining the yard installation, but will also undertake the
fitting of the electric light installations on board vessels built in
the yard. To supervise and manage this important department—which,
it may be remarked, is entirely novel as a branch of shipyard
work—the firm have engaged the services of a skilled electrician,
under whom a staff of operative electricians are employed.</p>

<p>On account of the increased employment it brings to their townspeople,
and also doubtless on grounds of increased economy and
efficiency, Messrs Denny seek to overtake, as much as possible, the
entire work connected with a ship’s construction and outfit in their
own establishment. Towards the close of 1881 they began the
introduction of a department for the designing, decoration, and
furnishing of the saloons of their vessels. This department is now
of established importance in the yard, and embraces four more or
less distinct branches. Firstly, the architectural and decorative
designs of the various saloons are determined upon by what may be
called the architectural branch, under the immediate supervision of
a professionally-trained architect. The work of practically carrying
out these designs is at present entrusted to three sections of
workers. (1) The decorative department, proper, which overtakes
the painting of the various ornamental panels, dados, friezes, &amp;c.,
of the saloons, and the staining of the coloured glass used in saloon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
windows, skylights, doors, &amp;c. (2) The carving department, in
which the carved work fitted on the bow and stern of vessels, also
the numerous small pieces of carved work introduced into the
architectural arrangement of the saloons, are overtaken. (3) The
upholstery department, in which all the work connected with
upholstering the saloons and state-rooms—usually, in other yards,
made the subject of sub-contract—is overtaken from first to last.
In this branch female labour is employed to a considerable extent,
while much of the decorative painting referred to above is also done
by females. Under the guidance of a lady artist, the employés in
this branch have evinced much aptitude and taste for the work.</p>

<p>Successive enlargements and increased appliances have now rendered
the Leven Shipyard capable of turning out from 40,000 to
60,000 tons of shipping per annum. The work hitherto achieved
has been almost exclusively that of steamship building, but inside
of that general limitation it has been of a varied and comprehensive
description. Steamships for many of the largest ocean and coast-trading
companies, gun-boats and transport ships for foreign Governments,
and light-draught paddle-steamers for the rivers Volga,
Danube, Ganges, and Irrawaddy, have all been furnished from the
stocks of Leven Shipyard. The accompanying list, which is of
work done during the period of the firm’s existence, viz., since
1844, affords at once an adequate conception of the large amount
of important work done for the better-known shipping companies:—</p>

<p>The firm, it may be stated, is now engaged in the construction
of their 300th vessel. Notwithstanding the work of re-arrangement
and enlargement which has been under progress for two years or
more, the work turned out during that period has been in no way
behind as compared with other periods—a fact which eloquently
testifies to the administrative ability of those in authority, and to
the skill and energy of Mr John Ward, the general manager
of Messrs Denny’s large works.</p>

<p>In August, 1880, the firm issued a notice to their workmen
stating that, having observed during the previous two years many
improvements in methods of work and appliances introduced by
them into the yard, they very readily recognised the advantage
accruing to their business from these efforts of their workmen’s skill,
and were desirous that they should not pass unrewarded. The
notice further stated that to carry out this desire an Awards Committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
had been appointed, which would consider any claims made
by the workmen, and grant an award in proportion to the worth of
the improvement made, the amount in no case to be more than £10,
or less than £2. The committee then appointed, and which still
holds office, was composed of well-known local gentlemen, in
every way competent to adjudicate. Fully a year later the firm
announced that in the case of an invention thought worthy of a
greater award than £10, they had empowered the Committee to grant
such an award, or were willing, in addition to giving an award of
£10, to take out at their own expense provisional protection at the
Patent Office on behalf of the inventor, so that he might either
dispose of his invention or complete the patent, provided always
they had free use of the thing patented in their own establishment.
From the reports which have yearly been issued by the committee, it
is apparent that considerable success has attended the scheme. The
number of claims made since its institution has been as follows:—In
1880, 12; in 1881, 32; in 1882, 27; in 1883, 20; in 1884
(till July only), 91; total, 182. Awards have been granted as
follows:—In 1880, 5; in 1881, 22; in 1882, 21; in 1883, 18; in
1884 (till July only), 27; total, 93. It is worthy of note that
about one-half of the awards have been gained by workmen in the
joiner’s department. Some of their machines have been modified
or altered so as to do twice the quantity of work previously possible,
some to do a new class of work, and others to do the same work
with greater ease and safety. Four inventions have gained the
maximum award of £10, viz., (1) an improvement made on ships’
water-closet and urinal; (2) the invention of a machine to cut
mouldings imitative of wicker work; (3) an improved arrangement
for disengaging steam and hand-steering gear on board ship; (4) an
improved method of laying the Decauville railway across the main
line. In connection with this latter invention, the patentee of the
Decauville railway system, supplemented the committee’s grant to
the extent of £10. In a note to last year’s report, the firm state
that they have decided to increase the maximum grant from £10 to
£12, and the minimum from £2 to £3; and that in the case of two
men being engaged at the same invention, should it be found worthy
of an award, each will receive at least the minimum award of £3.
A still more recent announcement states that “whenever any workman
has received as many as <em>five</em> awards from the committee, reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
from the time the scheme came in force, he shall be paid a
premium of £20, when he has received as many as <em>ten</em> awards he
shall be paid a further premium of £25—the premiums always
increasing by £5 for every additional five awards received.” Already,
it may be stated, four separate workmen have received <em>five</em> awards,
and become the recipients of the £20 premium.</p>

<p>With regard to the employment of females in Messrs Denny’s
yard, it may be interesting to state further that the total number
generally employed throughout the works amounts to between 80
and 100. In addition to the numbers employed in the decorative
and upholstery departments, already noticed, a large contingent
are engaged in the polishing rooms, and a further number in the
drawing offices as tracers. The employment of females as tracers
in shipyard drawing offices, it may be stated, is of recent date. The
system had previously been in operation at the locomotive works
of Messrs Dübs &amp; Co., and Messrs Neilson &amp; Co., of Glasgow.
Having proved a success there, it has been gradually adopted by
shipbuilding and engineering firms on the Clyde, and more recently
on the Tyne. The staff in Leven Shipyard consists of 20 members,
four of whom are employed in the experimental tank department.
All the girls are selected by written competitive examination,
the subjects of examination being arithmetic, writing to dictation,
and block-letter printing. At first it was intended the
girls should simply be trained as tracers, but they displayed such
aptitude that to tracing was added the inking-in of finished drawings
and the reduction of plans from a greater to a less scale. This
they do with a very fair degree of accuracy and neatness. The
experienced members of the staff are now employed making displacement
calculations, including plotting the results to scale, centre
of buoyancy, and metacentre calculations; calculations of ships’
surface, working up and plotting of speed trial results, stability
calculations. Most of these calculations are made out on prepared
printed schedules, and the whole of the work is superintended by
a member of the male staff. In the work of calculation the girls,
it may be stated, make large use of such instruments as the slide
rule, Amsler’s planimeter and integrator. To secure clearness and
uniformity in the work of writing titles, data, scantling, &amp;c., on
the various drawings and tracings, it was found advisable to train
the females in the art of lettering these features in a uniform style<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
of lettering in place of writing them. In this work they display considerable
proficiency and expertness, the results being uniformly
legible and well arranged.</p>

<p>Before passing from the subject of female employment in Messrs
Denny’s establishment, attention should be drawn to one fact, of
which assurances have been given by those well informed in the matter.
In no instance has the employment of females led to the displacement
of men as yard operatives. Those departments into which
females have recently been introduced are now numerically as large
as before the innovation. In some cases, indeed, the numbers are
greater than before; new avenues of labour, and greater elaboration
of the old, being the grounds of need for the accessions.</p>

<p>The other establishment selected for notice from the Clyde
district is:—</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">
MESSRS J. &amp; G. THOMSON’S<br>
SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING WORKS,<br>
CLYDEBANK.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The business of this firm was founded in 1846, by Messrs James
&amp; George Thomson, father and uncle respectively of the present
members of the firm. Originally the firm were engineers, but in
1851, shipbuilding operations were commenced, the yard being then
situated in the upper reaches of the Clyde. Twenty years later the
increase of the firm’s business and the demand for better accommodation
for shipping made it necessary for the firm to take new
ground. The present site at Clydebank was therefore chosen for
their shipyard, and since its formation many wonderful transformations
have been effected. It is fully twelve years since ground was
first broken. At that time there was neither house nor railway
accommodation, and the difficulties were not easily surmountable,
and it must have been determined courage and energy that in such
a short time not only formed such a large establishment, but created
a town, and introduced a railway. From Clydebank yard, it may
be needless to state, many of the most famous vessels of the Cunard,
Peninsular, and Oriental and Union Lines have been launched.
From its stocks have emanated such well-known vessels as the
<i>Bothnia</i>, <i>Gallia</i>, <i>Thames</i>, <i>Moor</i>, <i>Hammonia</i>, and the great Cunard
liner, <i>Servia</i>, while within a very recent period another vessel—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
<i>America</i>—seemingly destined to eclipse the fame of all these
other notable craft, has been built and sent to sea.</p>

<p>Until about two years ago, the engineering section of Messrs
Thomson’s business was conducted at Clydebank Foundry, Finnieston,
Glasgow. It was then resolved, however, to centralise the
works, and thus save the great expense of fitting out vessels away
from the yard, as well as secure the increased facilities offered in the
management and controlling of large bodies of workmen. This
important undertaking has now been accomplished, and the establishment,
as now arranged, is equal in extent and working capability
to any other private shipbuilding concern. The entire premises
occupy about thirty-five acres of land, and comprise building yard,
tidal basin, yard workshops, and engine and boiler works. When
in full operation the establishment gives employment to over 4,000
workmen. The yard possesses eight building slips, laid out for the
largest class of vessels, and owing to their situation—facing the
river Cart, which here joins the Clyde—excellent facilities for
the launching of vessels are afforded.</p>

<p>Proceeding to describe the works more in detail, as in the case
of a personal visit, the first feature that may be noticed is a handsome
block of buildings which stands some distance from the main
entrance to the shipyard. These buildings comprise the clerical,
managerial, and naval architects’ offices; also a spacious apartment
in which are located splendidly-executed models, and sections of
the hulls, of the vessels which have been built by the firm. Passing
through the yard large quantities of the raw material of the modern
shipbuilder are observed on railway waggons, and in sheds—including
iron and steel plates, bar, T, H, Z, angle, flat, channel, tubular,
and other forms of wrought-iron. This material is brought into the
yard by railway, which forms a siding of the North British system
about a quarter of a mile distant.</p>

<p>The iron and steel plates are first manipulated in a large shed
open at the sides and ends, and measuring some 500 feet by 150.
Here are situated a large number of powerful machine-tools—bending
and straightening machines, punching and shearing machines,
drilling machines, hydraulic riveting machines and the like. Some
are of the largest sizes made, one punching machine being a 33-inch
gap tool. Several other machine-tools in this large shed have
special features worthy of notice, and one in particular, a flat keel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
plate bending machine, must be referred to with some detail. The
machine in question was made by the Messrs Thomson themselves,
and constitutes perhaps the latest application of machinery to shipbuilding
purposes. It is supplied by hydraulic power from the
accumulator that works the riveting plant—which is on the
Tweddell system—and is composed of a number of arms resting on a
horizontal bar. The arms are raised or lowered to suit the different
shapes required, by means of a hydraulic ram placed at each end
and pressing upon the horizontal bars.</p>

<p>Leaving the machine-tool shed, which, by the way, is amply
provided, as indeed are the works generally, with travelling and
fixed lifting appliances, and while <i lang="fr">en route</i> for the smiths’ shop, are
observed several isolated punching and shearing and other machine-tools
for special purposes, and driven by self-contained engines or
hydraulic power. The smiths’ shop is a well-arranged workshop,
600 feet long by 60 feet wide, and contains 108 smiths’ fires,
besides three furnaces at each end for heating frames and plates, for
bending and other manipulative purposes. This department is well
supplied with the mechanical contrivances of the forge, including
steam hammers of various capacities graduating from 12 cwt. up to
over one ton. There are 16 small jobbing hammers in this shop;
a massive 70-cwt. hammer of Messrs Thomson’s own make, is used
in the production of stern-posts, rudders, and heavy forgings. The
smiths’ shop is built upon excellent and somewhat unusual principles,
the roof being so constructed as to readily admit of the egress
of the smoke from the fires, thus securing good ventilation.</p>

<p>An engineering and machine shop, well equipped with lathes,
drills, and other appliances, limited to the operations connected with
the production of water-tight doors, steering gears, and the like, is
next passed. In close proximity is the riggers loft, where a large
staff of workmen, with the aid of mechanical contrivances, manipulate
the rigging for the vessels nearing completion in the dock.
The firm’s well-appointed saw mills are provided with a full complement
of sawing machinery, much of it of a special and very
cleverly contrived character. One machine, for instance, is capable
of cross-cutting and ripping a log into the required sizes right away,
without the usual intermediate manipulation. The arrangements
for conveying the timber into position, and for removing it when
cut, are very complete, and eminently calculated to ensure rapidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of production. In convenient proximity to the saw mills are the
“saw-doctor’s” quarters. The old-fashioned practice of sharpening
the teeth of the saws by hand-filing is discarded here in favour of a
more rapid and effective method of obtaining the requisite amount
of sharpness and “set.” Emery-wheels are employed and accomplish
the process with a great saving of time and labour.</p>

<p>Amongst the other departments with regard to which no details
need be given, yet all of which are admirably appointed, are the brass
foundry and finishing shops, where the brass castings and fittings
are prepared. The joiners’, carpenters’, and cabinetmakers’ shops
are an important and extensive branch of the Clydebank premises.
The building in which they are located measures 220 feet in length,
by 156 feet in width. Here the ordinary ship-joinery work is undertaken,
and the tasteful and magnificent furnishings, used in the
luxurious equipment of the vessels built in the yard, are produced
in great numbers. The joiners’ and cabinetmakers’ shops are
provided with a vast number of ingenious sawing, wood-working,
as well as the more ordinary joinery appliances, manufactured for
the greater part by Messrs J. M‘Dowall &amp; Sons, Johnstone, near
Glasgow, and Fay &amp; Son, the well-known American house. It
is noteworthy that the belting for driving the multiplicity of
machines located in this department is all conducted below the
floor: in this way a welcome freedom from obstruction, and comparative
immunity from danger, is effected.</p>

<p>A word may be added with regard to the engines and boilers used
by the firm for driving their machinery. During the day the most
of the machinery is driven from these main engines, the chief of
which is a 200 horse-power motor, by Messrs Tangye, of Birmingham;
and at night the principal machine tools and several of the workshops
derive their requisite motive power from the small self-contained
engines, which are attached, or are in close proximity, to them.</p>

<p>The engineering and boilermaking section of the works occupies
in all a space of about 12,000 square yards. The boiler shop is a
large and lofty galleried workshop, occupying an area of 4,000
square yards. It is splendidly equipped with all the most modern
appliances for accurate and heavy work. Attention may specially
be drawn to an enormous hydraulic riveter, erected by Messrs
Brown Brothers, of Edinburgh. This riveter, which is just undergoing
completion, is designed with a 6½ feet gap, and can close with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
ease rivets up to 1¾ inch diameter. It is rendered necessary owing
to the tendency to greatly increase pressure since the introduction
of the triple expansion engine. An engine of 100 <span class="allsmcap">H.P.</span>, having a
steam accumulator, gives the necessary power for working this, and
advantage has been taken of the extra power to actuate a system of
hydraulic hoists, winches and capstans, which are being substituted
for the coal-devouring and often dangerous donkey boilers and steam
winches, usually in use for this purpose. The hoists will also be
applied to the larger latches in order to save manual labour.</p>

<p>When ready to be placed on board ship, the boilers are run down
to the dock by means of a tramway, in the foundations of which as
many as 600 tons of slag have been packed. The boilers are then
lifted on board and lowered to their proper place by means of
massive shear-legs, constructed by Taylor, of Birkenhead, which are
capable of lifting the enormous weight of 120 tons, and which
have a foundation composed of some 700 tons of cement.</p>

<p>The new engine works comprise erecting, turning, and tool shops,
smithy, brass foundry, and depot for laying castings and other
goods, also large stores. The whole cover an area of about 8,000
square yards, making, with the 4000 square yards occupied by the
boiler shop, a total area of 12,000 square yards. Machinery by the
well-known makers, Messrs Shanks, Heatherington, Harvey, and
others, of the most modern and powerful description, has been laid
down, also overhead travelling cranes, by Taylor, to lift 30 and 40
tons respectively. Railways have been introduced throughout the
shops, and a 6-ton crane locomotive lifts and deposits castings where
required. In fact, everything that the most modern engineering skill
could suggest has been introduced in order to fit the place for turning
out not only the largest class of marine engines, but also for the saving
of manual labour, and it is expected that 50,000 <span class="allsmcap">I.H.P.</span> can be turned
out per annum. The entire premises, it should be stated, are
illuminated by the electric light, partly on the “Brush” and partly
on the “Swan” systems. The vessels on the slips and in the dock
are also illuminated by electric light applied in a portable form.</p>

<p>Since having commenced shipbuilding operations, Messrs J. &amp;
G. Thomson have placed as many as 200 vessels in the water,
representing an aggregate of 300,000 tons, and a gross capital value
of about £7,500,000. The position, therefore, that Clydebank yard
takes amongst the shipbuilding establishments of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Kingdom is certainly in the very front rank. The general manager
of the extensive works is Mr J. P. Wilson, a gentleman of extended
experience, who has before held similar posts, but none more
onerous and exacting. Amongst other of the responsible officials
at Clydebank of whom mention should be made Mr J. H. Biles,
the firm’s naval designer, occupies an important position and shares
in the credit attaching to successful work.</p>
</div>

<p>The three yards selected from the Clyde district have now
been described, and their distinctive features enlarged upon.
In passing to the notices of the yards from other districts, it
may be stated that efforts will be made to avoid repetition in
details that are essentially similar. The notices will be of a
still more general character than those preceding, the only
portions where anything like fullness may occur being those
concerned with features which are not embraced in any of the
Clyde yards. The most stupendous and comprehensive of the
works to be noticed are those of:—</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">PALMERS SHIPBUILDING AND IRON COMPANY, LIMITED,<br>JARROW-ON-TYNE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Limited, have their
works at Jarrow-on-Tyne, about four miles from the sea. The
works embrace both banks of the river Tyne, cover nearly 100
acres of land, and employ about 7,000 persons. They were first
commenced in 1851 by Mr Charles Mark Palmer, the present M.P.
for North Durham, distinguished for the active part he has taken
and continues to take in merchant shipping legislation. In 1865 the
works were made into a limited company, Mr Palmer becoming chairman.
It is a saying in Jarrow, with reference to these gigantic works,
that the raw ironstone is taken in at the one end and launched from
the other in the form of iron steamships, fitted complete with all their
machinery, to carry on a large share of the world’s commerce.
However much this may appear the exaggerated utterance of native
pride, it must be declared to be a literal truth. The works include
within themselves the entire range of operations, from the raising
and smelting of the ironstone to the complete equipment of iron,
steam and sailing vessels of all sizes. The ore itself, raised at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
rate of 1,000 tons per day, is brought round by sea from the Company’s
own mines at Port Mulgrave, near Whitby, in Yorkshire,
and is lifted from the river wharf at the works up to the railway
level, along an inclined plane worked by a stationary engine. Coke
and coal come into the works from Marley Hill and other collieries
in Durham and Northumberland, by the Pontop and Jarrow
Railway. The coke is discharged into a hopper capable of holding
about 1,500 tons, from the bottom of which the blast furnace
barrows are filled through sliding doors, dispensing with manual
labour. The four blast furnaces are 85 feet high, 24 feet diameter
at the boshes, and 10 feet in the hearth. They are capable of producing
over 2,000 tons of pig per week, of which more than one-half
is used in the Company’s works. The blast is heated to about
1,500° Fahr. in eight “Whitewell” hot air fire-brick stoves of the
newest pattern, and there are eighteen kilns for calcining the Cleveland
ironstone. The rolling mill forge comprises eighty puddling
furnaces, producing over 1,000 tons of puddled bars weekly; which,
again, are rolled into plates and angle bars of the largest and smallest
sizes used in the trade. There are two forge engines with 36-inch
cylinders, one of 4 feet and the other of 5 feet stroke, each driving
a roll train and four pairs of 22-inch rolls. There are two plate
mills and ten mill furnaces, producing about 1,200 tons of finished
boiler and ship plates weekly. Each mill has two pairs of 24-in.
rolls, reversed by clutch and crabs; a bar mill with two pairs of
rolls, driven by a 24-inch cylinder, produces 120 tons per week; a
fourth mill, with four pairs of rolls, driven by two 30-inch cylinders,
with 4 feet stroke, produces about 300 tons per week of plates;
also a large angle and bar mill, driven by a single engine, having
36-inch cylinder and 4 feet stroke, capable of rolling the very
largest angles used in the trade. There is also a sheet mill in the
forge. Attached to the rolling mills are shears, circular saws,
punching, and straightening presses, all of the newest patterns.</p>

<p>The adjoining department is that of the engine works, which is
on the same gigantic scale, and is capable of finishing about forty
pairs of marine engines with their boilers, annually, besides a proportionate
share of replace boilers and repairs. The department
produces its own iron and brass castings and forgings. In the
boiler shop of this department vertical rolls for rolling long boiler
shell plates were first used, and may be seen in operation. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
year 1882-83, June to June, thirty-six pairs of engines, of 7,300
nominal and 39,240 indicated horse-power, were turned out.</p>

<p>The next department, occupying the east end of the Company’s
works, is that of shipbuilding. The shops of this department are
fitted up with all the newest machines for quick and efficient production
of work. It contains the largest graving dock on the coast, also a
very fine patent slip, fitted with hydraulic hauling gear. The
building slips are suitable for every kind of vessel up to 500 feet in
length, and are capable, with those in the Howdon branch of the
works on the opposite side of the river, of launching 70,000 tons
of shipping annually. There are nine building slips at Jarrow, and
six at Howdon. In the year 1882-83, June to June, 35 vessels of
the aggregate tonnage of 68,000 tons were built and delivered to
their owners. For transporting material throughout the works,
three steam travelling cranes and eleven locomotive engines are
employed. For discharging ore, two fixed and two travelling steam
cranes, also two hydraulic cranes, are in use. At the engine works
are sheer-legs 100 feet high, capable of lifting 100 tons—used for
lifting engines and boilers, and for masting the vessels.</p>

<p>The output of tonnage by Palmers’ Company for 1882 and
that for 1883 were severally about double the amount turned
out by any other one firm in existence for these years. The
following statement of the yearly amount of tonnage turned out by
the firm since the commencement of iron shipbuilding on the Tyne
in 1852, will be interesting, as showing the gradual strides by which
the firm have risen from 920 tons thirty years ago to the wonderful
return of 61,113 tons in 1883:—</p>

SIR WM. ARMSTRONG, MITCHELL &amp; CO.’S SHIPBUILDING WORKS,<br>
LOW WALKER AND ELSWICK-ON-TYNE.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Low Walker yard of this firm was commenced upwards of
thirty years ago by Messrs C. Mitchell &amp; Co., who up to 1883
(when they amalgamated with Sir W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co., the
notable firm of engineers and artillerists), had built as many as
450 vessels, or an average of 15 vessels per annum, the average
tonnage produced during the last ten years being 23,000 tons. The
yard is situated about four miles down the Tyne from Newcastle.
It consists of about fifteen acres of ground, and has nine launching berths,
but their arrangement is such that at times there have been
as many as fourteen vessels on the stocks. The establishment is laid
out in a most modern manner. The space occupied by the building
slips has a uniform gradient, and, being perfectly flat laterally,
gives the greatest facility in the movement of bogies. The yard is
served by two complete systems of railways, respectively on the 4 feet
8-in. and 2 feet 3-in. gauge. The former is in connection with a siding
from the North Eastern Railway, whereby materials and goods can
be brought from all parts of the kingdom, and two locomotives are
constantly employed working the trucks into the yard, one of them
being of very special construction, on Brown’s patent principle,
manufactured by Messrs R. &amp; W. Hawthorn, Newcastle. This
locomotive is combined with a steam crane, the jib of which acts
as a lever with fulcrum, thus dispensing with chains, and which
readily swings right round, depositing the plates on edge into racks
arranged on either side of the railway, from which they can be
taken with great facility by the workmen at the appropriate time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>The yard is divided in two by a building 250 feet long by 50
feet wide, placed at right angles to the river, and which contains
plate furnaces, bolt-maker’s shop, plumber’s shop, rivet store, tool
stores, large bending rolls, straightening machine, and man-hole
punch, on the ground floor; and on the upper storey rigging loft,
sail loft, pattern stores, &amp;c. Along the head of the building berths
in one half of the yard there is a line of machine shops 400 feet
long by 70 feet wide, in one end of which are installed frame furnaces,
bending blocks, &amp;c., as also a number of powerful punching
machines, planing machines, special machines for angle cutting,
and there has recently been added a powerful radial drill, having
four moveable arms arranged to drill holes in any part of plate 16
feet by 4 feet without moving it. At the back of this machine
shop, and parallel with it, is a smith’s shop 180 feet long by 50 feet
wide, fitted up complete with steam hammers, &amp;c. For the other
half of the yard there is a large building 200 feet long, and of an
average width of about 150 feet, which contains furnace, with
bending blocks, &amp;c., several heavy punching machines, planing
machines, drilling and other machines; one portion about 80 feet
by 60 feet being used as a fitting shop, containing powerful lathes,
radial, and other drilling machines on the ground floor, and on the
upper floor a lighter class of shaping, drilling, and other machines.
In this building are also constructed two drying stoves, wherein the
exhaust steam from the engine is used for drying timber. At the
upper end of this machine shop is another blacksmiths’ shop 130
feet long by 50 feet wide, containing steam hammer and drilling
machines for special work. A separate building, 80 feet long by
50 feet, is used for the bending and welding of beams, and is so
placed that the beams can be lifted direct from barges alongside
quay, and laid in position, ready for use.</p>

<p>The smiths’, fitters’, and other similar shops are all conveniently
situated; and as the vessels lie alongside the quay to be finished off
after launching, the minimum of expense in this respect is incurred.
There are numerous steam cranes of 10 tons and under on the quays
for landing such portion of the material as comes by water, and also to
lift articles on board the vessels fitting out.</p>

<p>The sawmills, joiners’ shops, mould loft, &amp;c., are situated at the
lower end of the yard, and the appliances for handling and converting
timber are most complete. The wood-cutting machinery is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
extensive, and embraces most of the newest labour-saving machines.
The establishment in full work employs 2,500 men, and has
turned out as much as 30,000 tons gross register of shipping in a year,
including almost every type of vessel for mercantile and war purposes,
which latter branch of work will now have a further
development since the amalgamation with the eminent gun-making
firm of Sir W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co. For this purpose a new
yard has been laid out at Elswick, adjoining the Ordnance Works,
which will be of the most complete character.</p>

<p>The site of this new yard comprises about 20 acres, and at first
only half-a-dozen building berths will be laid out, but as the frontage
is about 2,000 feet, the number of these can be augmented as
required. The buildings already erected or in progress embrace a
brick built shop, 265 feet long by 60 feet wide, standing at the
western portion of the ground, and at right angles to the river.
This building is in three storeys, the lower portion being intended
for general stores, tool and rivet stores, fitting shop, &amp;c.; the second
floor will be entirely used as a joiners’ shop, and fitted up in the
most complete manner with wood-working machinery of every
description. The upper floor will be used as a draughting loft and
model-room. Parallel to this building, and a little distance from
it, will be a blacksmith’s shop, 150 feet by 50 feet. Adjoining the
larger building above described, and at right angles to it, is the
office block, 120 feet by 45 feet. Along the head of the launching
berths stands a tool shed 420 feet long by 40 feet wide, containing
the ordinary punching, planing, drilling, and other shipbuilding
machines, all of the newest and most powerful type. Near the
centre of the site is a large shed 220 feet long, consisting of four
bays, each 50 feet wide, the whole carried on cast-iron columns,
which will comprise the plate and angle furnaces, bending blocks,
beam shop, angle smiths’ shop, plate rolls, large and small, also keel
plate bending machine, &amp;c. The yard is served by a complete
system of railways, having a siding from the North Eastern Railway
Company’s system. Material can therefore be brought from all parts
of the kingdom and deposited in any part of the premises.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary further to give the particulars of this
establishment, suffice it to say that it is being laid out on the
experience gained up to date in existing shipyards, and will therefore
embrace the newest and most important tools in all branches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
of work. The intention is that it shall be capable of turning out
every description of vessel up to the largest iron-clad, and the construction
of war vessels of all kinds will be made a speciality, seeing
that the Company can send them to sea completely armed and
equipped ready for service. Looking to the magnitude of the
establishment, it can be regarded as nothing less than an arsenal,
which in time of war would be invaluable to the country. The present
and prospective importance of this development of the combined
firms’ business may be inferred simply from the fact of the services
of so high an authority as Mr W. H. White, late Chief Constructor
of the Navy, having been secured as naval adviser and manager.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">DEPTFORD SHIPBUILDING YARD AND REPAIRING DOCKS,<br>SUNDERLAND.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These works, established so far back as 1793, but greatly transformed
and extended to suit modern requirements, are owned and
presided over by Mr James Laing, son of Mr Philip Laing, their
founder. The yard consists of two general sections, situated one
on each side of the main road leading to the river Wear. One of
these, commonly termed the “Woodyard,” is where wood shipbuilding
was conducted in the early days, but which now of course, in
common with the other section, is used exclusively for iron shipbuilding.
The entire works, including offices, docks, brass foundry,
and other premises, cover an area of about thirty acres.</p>

<p>The yard embraces the various shops and sheds usually pertaining
to building operations in iron, such as iron-working sheds, smiths’
shop, joiners’ shop, upholsterers’ shop, bookmakers’ shop, &amp;c., all
well equipped with machine-tools and appliances, needful in producing
vessels for the most important shipping companies. The two
general sections of the yard are each worked by one compound surface
condensing engine, all machines being driven by belting from
main lines of shafting, no independent engines being fitted. Scrive-boards,
frame furnace, bending blocks, garboard bender, and other
machinery are fitted in each section. Gorman’s gas furnaces are
used for heating the material, and these, though rather troublesome
when first fitted, about twelve years ago, after some alterations in
the details, now give complete satisfaction, and surpass in efficiency
ordinary coal furnaces. The joiners’ shop is situated in the wood-yard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
and the smith’s shop in the other section. In the smith’s
shop a separate engine is provided to drive the blast, so that if it is
desired the wood-yard can be kept completely going without having
the main engine in the other section at work.</p>

<p>The berths of Deptford yard, have been occupied since the commencement
of iron shipbuilding there, over thirty years ago, with
vessels for home and foreign shipowners, amongst others for such
well known companies as the Peninsular and Oriental Company,
the Union Company, the Royal Mail Company, the West India and
Pacific Company, the Royal Netherlands Company, and the Hamburg
and South American Company. In 1882 the <i>Mexican</i>, of
4670 tons gross measurement, the largest passenger vessel ever
built on the North-East Coast, and one of the finest of the Union
Company’s fleet of South African mail steamers, was launched from
the stocks of Deptford yard. Including the <i>Mexican</i>, the following
is the list of vessels launched by Mr Laing in the year named:—</p>

<p>At present Mr Laing is building his 301st iron vessel, which
represents the 460th vessel produced within the Deptford yard since
its commencement in 1793. The work presently on hand chiefly
consists of average size steam vessels, combining cargo-carrying
powers with high-class accommodation for passengers, several being
lighted throughout by electricity, and one being constructed of
steel, and having engines on the triple expansion principle.</p>

<p>Connected with the shipbuilding yard there are two graving docks
of 300 feet and 400 feet in length, one on each side of the river.
One of these is situated at the west side of the iron yard parallel
to the building berths, and therefore conveniently placed for all
kinds of alterations and repairs to vessels. This dock is kept dry
by means of pumps which act as circulating pumps for the condensers
of the yard engines. The pumps used for emptying this dock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
as well as the one on the other side of the river, after a vessel has
come in, are of the “Pulsometer” type of large size. The capacity
of these docks is such that in one year alone the amount of shipping
operated upon, either in the way of repairs, alterations, or simple
docking, has reached nearly 60,000 tons. A large number of vessels
have undergone the important process of lengthening in these docks—a
special and very important branch of shipwork in which Mr
Laing has been conspicuously successful. The largest undertaking
of this kind was the lengthening of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company’s screw-steamer <i>Poonah</i> in 1874 from a length of 315 feet
to that of 395, or an increase of 80 feet. The work was satisfactorily
completed, and the results of the vessel’s after-behaviour at sea were
communicated, along with an account of the work of lengthening, to
the Institution of Naval Architects by Mr Edwin De Russett, of the
Peninsular and Oriental Company, in 1877.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the shipyard are extensive brass and copper works,
employing about 300 hands, which, besides supplying all the brass
and plumber work required for vessels in the shipyard, undertake
similar work for other shipbuilders, also work for the Navy, such as
cast gun-metal rams and stern-posts for men-of-war, and brackets
for outer-bearings in twin-screws. All sorts of steam and other
fittings—Manchester goods—are also here manufactured and dispersed
to all parts of the world. Within the same premises are
situated the requisite machinery for effecting repairs to the engines
and boilers of vessels overhauled in the docks.</p>

<p>At present a large range of new Commercial and Drawing Offices
are being erected near the principal entrance to the yard. A new
joiner’s shop and sawmill will shortly be erected, and other alterations
in the internal economy of the shipyard are contemplated.
The new range of offices referred to, have a frontage of about 300
feet, and comprise strong room for the preservation of the firm’s
books, drawings, &amp;c.; model-room, 40 feet in length; foremen’s
room, 40 feet by 30 feet; general office, 42 feet by 41 feet; private
offices for Mr Laing &amp; Sons; drawing office, 45 feet by 40 feet;
moulding loft, 78 feet by 40 feet; model-making room, &amp;c. An
additional and somewhat noteworthy feature in the new buildings
will be a large dining hall for the use of those workmen who
have their meals brought to them at the yard. Also, a commodious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
gymnasium for the benefit of the youth in the employ. These are,
in addition to the large “British Workman” already in existence,
built by Mr Laing for the use of his employés, and for others who
care to subscribe. This institution, comprising dining room, game
rooms, smoking room and library, is managed by a committee of the
employés, and is self-supporting, a contribution of only one half-penny
per week being the qualification for membership, admitting
subscriber to all the benefits of the institution.</p>
</div>


<p class="p1 pfs80">THE WORKS OF THE BARROW SHIPBUILDING COMPANY (LIMITED).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Barrow Shipbuilding Company, Limited, was promoted in
1876 by several gentlemen in Barrow connected with the Furness
Railway, the Docks, and Steel Works, chief among whom was Mr
Ramsden (now Sir James Ramsden) then managing director of the
Furness Railway, Mayor of Barrow, and leading spirit in its development
generally. The Duke of Devonshire, the largest proprietor in
the district and in the other public works mentioned, became the
largest shareholder and the chairman of the new shipbuilding company,
which was then formally constituted, with Mr Robert Duncan,
shipbuilder of Port-Glasgow, as managing director. Mr Duncan
designed the whole arrangement of the works as they now stand,
and continued to act as managing director till 1875, when he
resigned, and was succeeded by Sir James Ramsden, with Mr James
Humphreys as manager, which position the latter held till 1880,
when he was succeeded by Mr William John, of Lloyd’s Register,
to whose talent as a naval architect some tribute has been elsewhere
passed in this work.</p>

<p>The total area of the plot of land on which these works stand is
58 acres, with two water frontages, each 1050 feet long, one
towards Walney Channel, into which the ships are launched, the
other towards the docks where the ships are fitted out. The
Walney Channel is sufficiently wide to allow of the launching of
the largest vessels without risk, and the site is altogether an exceptionably
favourable one. The shipbuilding is carried on in that
part of the yard adjoining the Walney Channel, being divided
from the engine works by a road, under which is a sub-way, which
affords the required communication between the two departments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>Entering the shipbuilding department by the main gate-way in this
dividing road the visitor finds himself in a large square, formed by
substantial buildings; to the left hand on entering, are the offices,
and to the right some of the smaller shops. The opposite side of the
square is occupied by the machine shed and smiths’ shops, whilst on
the right-hand side of the square are the frame-bending shed, and on
the left the joiners’ shop and the sawmill. Passing through the
offices upstairs, the visitor enters a very fine drawing office and
model-room, 100 feet by 50 feet, in which an efficient staff of
designers are engaged. On the ground floor are the counting-house,
officials’ rooms, &amp;c., and beyond these the stores for the
supply of everything required in building and outfitting ships and
machinery. From the stores, or by the outside square, the moulding
loft, 250 feet by 50 feet, is reached, of which the joiners’ shop
is a continuation. This department is 300 feet long by 60 feet
wide, and is fitted with every modern appliance in the way of tools
to facilitate work. At the back of this shop is an immense room,
600 ft. by 60 ft., occupied by a sawmill, and used also for spar-making,
boat-building, and rigging. Above these rooms, in continuation
of the drawing office and model-room, from which it may
be entered, is the cabinet-making department, which necessarily
requires a large amount of space in an establishment where passenger
and emigrant ships of the largest types are equipped
ready for sea. The iron-working machine shed, 360 ft. by 100 ft.,
and the frame-bending shed, 300 ft. by 180 ft., follow in order,
occupying the whole of one, and most of the other side of the
square above described. Both of these sections are fully equipped
with the machinery necessary for the rapid manipulation of material.
The smiths’ shop, 200 ft. by 120 ft., contains one hundred fires and
seven steam hammers, the former being blown by a Schiele fan.
Attached to the smiths’ shop are shops for fitting smith-work and
for galvanizing. All these shops and sheds occupy less than one-third
of the ground devoted to the shipbuilding department.</p>

<p>Beyond the machine shop are the slip-ways, twelve in number,
where vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 40,000 tons have frequently
been seen at one time in various stages of construction.
On these slip-ways have been built the well-known mail steamer
<i>City of Rome</i> and the steamship <i>Normandie</i>, the largest vessel of
the French mail service. Here also were built for the Anchor Line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
the <i>Anchoria</i>, the <i>Devonia</i>, the <i>Circassia</i>, and the <i>Furnessia</i>; for the
Ducal Line, the <i>Duke of Devonshire</i>, the <i>Duke of Buccleuch</i>, the
<i>Duke of Lancaster</i>, the <i>Duke of Buckingham</i>, and the <i>Duke of
Westminster</i>. From these slip-ways also emanated the <i>Ganges</i> and
the <i>Sutlej</i> for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company
as well as the <i>Eden</i> and the <i>Esk</i> for the Royal Mail Steam
Packet Company. For the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company,
the <i>Ben my Chree</i>, the <i>Fenella</i>, and the <i>Peveril</i>. For the
<span lang="fr"><ins class="corr" id="tn-182" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Société Anomyne'">
Société Anonyme</ins> de Navigation Belge Américaine</span>, the s.s. <i>Belgenland</i> and
<i>Rhyhland</i>. For the Castle Line, the s.s. <i>Pembroke Castle</i>, and for
the <span lang="fr">Société Générale de Transports Maritimes à Vapeur</span> of Marseilles,
the s.s. <i>Navarre</i> and <i>Bearn</i>. Here were also produced the
<i>Kow Shing</i> for the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, and
the <i>Takapuna</i> for the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand,
besides many other vessels well known to the mercantile world. For
the Admiralty this yard has turned out seven gun-boats, namely, the
<i>Foxhound</i>, the <i>Forward</i>, the <i>Grappler</i>, the <i>Wrangler</i>, the <i>Wasp</i>, the
<i>Banterer</i>, and the <i>Espoir</i>, as well as four torpedo mooring ships.</p>

<p>Leaving the shipbuilding department, the visitor passes through
the afore-mentioned sub-way to the engine works, which occupies an
area of ground equal to that of the shipyard proper. To the left
may be noticed the coppersmith’s shop, the brass foundry, and the
engineer’s smithy. The Foundry has seven ordinary pot furnaces,
and one large reverberatory air furnace for castings of the heaviest
class. The smithy is well fitted up with hammers suitable for the
work. On the opposite side of the ground are two buildings, the one
to the left containing the iron foundry and boiler shop. The foundry,
250 ft. by 150 ft., provided with overhead travellers, is capable of
turning out the largest castings required for the monster marine
engines of the present day. The boiler shop is the same size, and
possesses the most modern contrivances for the skilful and economical
execution of work, and it contains a complete equipment of hydraulic
riveting machines, both fixed and portable, the largest having a gap
of 10 feet and a pressure of 90-lbs.</p>

<p>In the space between the boiler shop and the machine shop
there are situated a well-arranged furnace for heating, and the
vertical rolls for bending the large plates forming the shells of
the marine boilers. In the furnace just mentioned the plates
are heated while standing on their edge, and as the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
furnace is level with the ground, they are readily lifted out by
a portable crane and deposited on the bed-plate adjoining the
vertical rolls. In this vacant space is also situated the water tower
for the accumulator for the 100-ton crane, constructed by Sir Wm.
G. Armstrong and erected at the side of the Devonshire Dock,
where the machinery is placed on board and fixed for new ships.</p>

<p>The engine shop, although 420 ft. long by 100 ft. wide, is
scarcely large enough for the pressure of work oftentimes concentrated
there. This shop is unsurpassed in the completeness of its
fittings and the perfection of its tools. It, like most of the other
shops in the establishment, is fitted up with the electric light.</p>

<span class="fs80">OUTPUT OF TONNAGE IN THE PRINCIPAL DISTRICTS.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">With the change from wood to iron shipbuilding, and with
the development of propulsion by steam instead of sails,
the shipbuilding industry has become localised and concentrated
in those districts which, besides possessing the <i lang="la">sine qua
non</i> of ready outlet to the vast ocean, are specially favoured
in being the repositories of immense natural wealth in the form
of coal and ores. What may now fairly be considered the great
centres of shipbuilding are the valleys of the Clyde, Tyne,
Wear, and Tees, and also the Thames and Mersey, although
these latter rivers have for a considerable number of years been
overshadowed as building centres by the immensity of their
shipping. In several other districts, of course, shipbuilding is
carried on to a considerable extent, and some of these may yet
attain much greater importance than they at present possess.
Barrow-in-Furness, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of
recent years, is still advancing. Belfast occupies a prominent
position, not alone because of the large annual output of tonnage,
but by reason of the number of high-class ocean steamships
which have been, and continue to be, built there. Dundee,
Leith, Hull, Southampton, and other places throughout the
United Kingdom, are not without claims to recognition on
account of the shipbuilding carried on.</p>

<p>The supremacy of one shipbuilding centre over another in
the matter of work accomplished, both with regard to its
character and its quantity, not infrequently forms the subject
of comment in the columns of journals circulating in the
districts concerned. The publication, by these journals, at
the close of each year, of the returns of new tonnage produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
by the various firms, affords an opportunity for vaunting on
such matters, and it is, as a rule, taken advantage of by the
compilers of the statements, who are usually members of the
staff on the journals in question. These statements, through
the interesting nature of the statistics they contain, are widely
read, and the labour attaching to their preparation must indeed
be considerable. The figures are, as a rule, supplied by the
shipbuilders themselves, and from a summation of these the
compiler draws his conclusions. The accuracy of the returns
and the fairness of the comments based upon them, if not
always completely satisfactory, are thus seen to be matters for
which the compiler is not wholly responsible.</p>

<p>Frequent exception has been taken by correspondents to
discrepancies in the tonnages of individual vessels given
in these reports, as compared with the tonnages measured
by the Board of Trade officials, and entered in their records.
Attention was called to this matter at the close of 1883
by a correspondent in <cite>Engineering</cite>, whose assertions were
afterwards corroborated in other journals. From a careful
checking of the returns made by the Glasgow press of the
shipbuilding on the Clyde for the three previous years this
correspondent maintained that the aggregate tonnage was
overstated to the extent of about 11,000 per year, or over
34,100 tons for the period named. One very gross instance
of the misstatement complained of was given by a second correspondent
writing to the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>, who drew attention,
along with the returns of other firms, to that of a firm building
the smaller class of vessels, who were stated in the <cite>Herald’s</cite>
account to have produced 8,300 tons, when by a careful comparison
with the actual tonnages of the vessels as recorded in
Lloyd’s Register, their total output was found to fall short of the
figure given by as much as 2,172 tons, equivalent to 35 per
cent. of the actual output. In commenting on these discrepancies
several obvious considerations suggested themselves to
the critics: such as possible misapprehension, caused by the
existence of several kinds of “tonnages,” and the difficulty of
stating accurately the tonnages of vessels recently launched.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
It was questioned, however, after all such allowances were
made, whether those furnishing the figures could be exonerated
from the sin of carelessness, or indeed, of pure falsification with
the view of figuring prominently in the list. The accuracy of
these criticisms has not in any way been disproved, nor has
any satisfactory explanation been offered.</p>

<p>While no attempt will here be made to solve the matter, it
has been felt that, in justice to the subject, these charges could
not be ignored when presenting statistics which are derived
mainly from the sources thus challenged. Indeed, in comparing
for the present work the statistics given by various
journals—even in journals confined to the same district—innumerable
disparities have been met with, and the agreement
has only been <i lang="fr">en grosse</i>. Such being the case, it may be asked,
could not other and more reliable sources be consulted? The
obvious alternative of using the authoritative returns of the
Board of Trade, or of Lloyd’s Register, at once suggests itself,
but objections to this are even more serious than to using the
press statistics. The returns issued annually by the Board of
Trade only relate to “Merchant Shipping” registered as such,
whereas it is well known that in the returns furnished by the
shipbuilders all sorts of vessels built by them are included, and
that a very considerable tonnage in war vessels and small
vessels for military purposes, also in light-draught river craft,
both for our own and other countries, is annually turned out
from merchant shipyards. The same objections apply to Lloyd’s
Register Summary, although, strangely enough, the figures there
more nearly correspond with the builders’ than with the Board
of Trade returns, the information given in both cases being the
gross tonnage of merchant shipping built and registered in the
United Kingdom. Everything considered, the statistics compiled
from press returns more accurately represent the work
accomplished throughout the districts than those afforded by
any of the sources named. In the statistics which follow,
therefore, the press returns have been adopted, but to simplify
matters for purposes of comparison—the degree of unreliability
warranting it—the terminal figures in large quantities have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
been reduced or increased to hundredths, according as they have
chanced to be under or above fifty.</p>

<p>The <ins class="err" id="err-187" title="Erratum: was 'fluctuations'">fluctuation</ins> from year to year in the shipbuilding industry
of the principal districts over an extended period is
exhibited in an interesting manner by the diagram facing
page 188, consisting of curves set up on equidistant ordinates
representing years, to the scale shown on the right of the
diagram. The figures from which the curves have been
constructed will be found to the left of the diagram.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It is matter of considerable regret to the author that his
utmost efforts to obtain statistics for the Tyne over a period
corresponding to that for which the Clyde figures are available
have not been rewarded with success. Many likely sources
have been consulted, and several gentlemen connected with the
river and its industries have been appealed to, but without any
satisfactory result. No systematic record of shipbuilding output
has been kept by anyone officially concerned with the
river, although in every other respect its progress has been
abundantly and accurately chronicled. It is only so recently
as 1878 that the <cite>Newcastle Chronicle</cite> begun the practice of
giving, in the systematic and complete manner for which it is
now justly noted, the returns of shipbuilding throughout the
Kingdom. To this journal the author is indebted for the
figures of work done on the Tyne during the years subsequent
to 1878. The figures for the Wear have been taken from an
article descriptive of that district appearing in the <cite>Shipping
World</cite> for June of the present year.</p>

<p>With regard to the Clyde, it is interesting to observe how
in the curve the periods of greatest activity, and consequent
output, are recurrent every tenth year. Thus at 1864, 1874, and,
at all events, 1883, the curve forms decided crests as compared
with the general undulations over the intervening years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>During the seven years from 1846 to 1852 inclusive the
number of steam vessels built on the Clyde amounted to 14
with wood hulls, 233 with iron hulls—total, 247, of which 141
were paddle-steamers and 106 screw-steamers. The tonnage
of the wooden steamers amounted to 18,330, and of the iron
vessels to 129,270 tons; the horse-power of the engines in the
wooden hulls being 6,740, and in the iron hulls 31,590. In
1851, or nearly a decade earlier than the year at which the
curve begins, the number of ships produced was 41, with an
aggregate tonnage of 25,320. In 1861, a decade later, 81
steamers were built, the tonnage of which amounted to 60,185,
and the horse-power of the engines, 12,493. The tonnage for
both steamers and ships, however, during that year was 66,800,
as shown by the diagram. During the seven years immediately
prior to 1862 the extent and progress of shipbuilding on the
river were such that 636 vessels, having an aggregate tonnage
of 377,000 tons, were launched from the yards of Glasgow,
Greenock, and Dumbarton.</p>

<p class="p1">With the year just spoken of a first and very considerable
rise in the tonnage output set in and continued till the year
1864, in which year it amounted to 178,500 tons. Various
causes of an exceptional nature, or at least, causes apart from
the natural progress due to the growth of shipping, were at
work in bringing about this increase in the output. The most
prominent of these was the necessity which arose for filling
up the gaps produced by the withdrawal of many swift
steamers from the river and coasting trade to meet the requirements
of individuals interested in running the blockade of the
ports of the Southern States of America. Between Aprils
1862-3 alone, as many as 30 vessels actively connected in some
way with the Clyde and coasting service, were sold for that
purpose, and the replacement of these vessels went a considerable
way in occasioning the briskness. Another and more
abiding cause, however, was the demand for vessels for the
cotton-carrying trade. This arose chiefly from the blockade
of the American ports, causing cotton to come right from the
East Indies and China; and in consequence of the longer
voyage many more ships were necessary to carry on the trade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
The fact that more than an average number of wrecks had
occurred during the two previous winters, together with an
increase of the trade between Britain and France as the result
of Mr Cobden’s commercial treaty, were elements lending
impetus to the briskness in the shipbuilding of the time.</p>

<p>In 1865 the output of tonnage was lessened considerably
through what appears to have been but the natural course of
commerce in its reactionary stage. This lessened activity was
much aggravated when 1866 was reached, and in that year
a serious interruption to the trade was caused by a lock-out
of the workmen consequent on a partial strike made to enforce
what the employers considered an unreasonable demand on
the part of the men. In 1867 the output was as low as
108,000 tons, but thereafter it took an upward tendency, its
rise to the previous level being sudden, but thereafter very
gradual, and spread over a number of years. The output kept
steadily improving each year, outreaching former totals, until
in 1874 the curve, or, as it may be called, the output wave,
formed a crest of exceptional altitude. For that year the
aggregate output reached the unprecedented figure of 262,430
tons, a result which made natural all subsequent references to
1874 as the “big year.” The year 1875, although showing an
increase in the number of vessels built, yet fell considerably
short of 1874 in the matter of tonnage, thus giving to the output
curve a decided downward turn. Matters continued to
grow worse during 1876, and many of the Clyde firms had
painful experiences of “bare poles” until about the beginning
of the year 1877, when a slightly improved state of matters
set in. Then there was a general desire amongst the workmen
for an advance in wages, which ultimately resulted in
the great shipwright strike of midsummer, 1877. This strike,
it may be remembered, lasted twenty-four weeks, and was one
of the most determined struggles which ever took place in
this country, both parties having evidently made up their
minds to hold out to the last. The strike culminated in the
general lock-out of workmen in the autumn of the same year,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
which, when withdrawn in favour of arbitration as regards
the shipwrights, settled down into a keen fight with the ironworkers.
The shipwrights’ claim was settled by arbitration,
the umpire (Lord Moncrieff) deciding in favour of the employers,
and the men accordingly resumed work. The ironworkers’
dispute was likewise a difficult matter to decide, but
ultimately the men resumed work on the understanding that
their claim for an advance upon their wages of 10 per cent.
would be considered six months subsequently. The struggles
were exceedingly costly alike to masters and workmen, one of
the results being seen pretty distinctly in the diminished
output of tonnage during 1877.</p>

<p>About the spring of 1878 matters had not improved in any
very material sense; and the ironworkers insisting on a settlement
of their former claim for an advance, were met by the
employers with a proposal to increase the working hours from
51 per week, as arranged in 1872, to 54 hours per week, or to
reduce the then rate of wages. The men were not unnaturally
averse to the increase of working hours, and signified their
opposition. Subsequently a reduction in wages of 7½ per
cent. was enforced, with the result that the ironworkers came
out on strike for a time. Ultimately in the spring of 1879
a return to the 54 hours was made. The prevailing great
depression continued well on into the autumn of 1879. In
October of that year the shipbuilding industry experienced an
unexpected but very welcome revival, and an unusually large
amount of work came to the Clyde. The output which in
1879 had fallen to 174,800 tons, now took a sudden and
remarkable jump, the figure for 1880 amounting to no less
than 248,650 tons, affording ample grounds for the belief that
the impetus at the close of 1879 was no mere temporary
spurt, but a solid revival. Subsequent experience has more
than justified this belief. In 1881 the output reached the
aggregate of 341,000 tons, in 1882 it overstepped even this, and
the output curve continued in the ascendant until for the year
1883 the stupendous aggregate of 419,600 tons was reached.
Following the course which accepted theories regarding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
industrial activity and depression suggest, and which actual
experience in the past exemplifies, the curve of output ought
still to be in the ascendant, reaching its maximum in 1884,
and thereafter declining. Although the close of the year is
still some distance off, there is already ample reason to believe
that this will not hold good for 1884. This result is after all
only very natural when the most exceptional activity of the
past four years, coupled with the present very unhealthy state
of the shipping trade, are taken into consideration.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The history of iron shipbuilding on the North-East Coast
district does not commence until the year 1840. In March
of that year the <i>John Garrow</i>, of Liverpool, a vessel of 800
tons burthen, the first iron ship seen in the North-East Coast
rivers, arrived at Shields, and caused considerable excitement.
A shipbuilding firm at Walker commenced to use the new
material almost immediately, and on the 23rd of September,
1842, the iron steamer <i>Prince Albert</i> glided from Walker Slipway
into the waters of the Tyne.</p>

<p>During the next eight or ten years very little progress was
made, the vessels mostly in demand being colliers, in the construction
of which no one thought of applying iron. About
the year 1850, the carriage of coal by railway began seriously
to affect the sale of north country coal in the London market,
and it became essential, in the interest of the coal-owners
and others, to devise some means of conveying the staple
produce of the North Country to London in an expeditious,
regular, and, at the same time, economical manner. To accomplish
this object, Mr C. M. Palmer caused an iron screw-steamer
to be designed in such a manner as to secure the greatest
possible capacity, with engines only sufficiently powerful to
ensure her making her voyages with regularity. This vessel
(the <i>John Bowes</i>), the first screw collier, was built to carry 650
tons, and to steam about nine miles an hour. On her first
voyage, she was laden with 650 tons of coals in four hours;
in forty-eight hours she arrived in London; in twenty-four
hours she discharged her cargo; and in forty-eight hours more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
she was again in the Tyne; so that, in five days, she performed
successfully an amount of work that would have taken two
average-sized sailing colliers upwards of a month to accomplish.
To the success of this experiment may be attributed, in great
measure, the subsequent and rapid development of iron shipbuilding
in the Tyne and East Coast district. The district
has maintained by far the largest share—almost amounting to
a monopoly—in the production of the heavy-carrying, slow-speed
type of cargo steamers, of which the <i>John Bowes</i> may be
said to have been the prototype.</p>

<p>Statistics for the Tyne, as already explained, are not available
to any extent until within recent years,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but from a paper
on “The Construction of Iron Ships and the Progress of Iron
Shipbuilding on the Tyne, Wear, and Tees,” written by Mr
C. M. Palmer, and forming part of the work, “The Industrial
Resources of the Tyne, Wear, and Tees,” published in connection
with the British Association’s visit to Newcastle in 1863,
it appears that the tonnage of iron ships launched from the
Tyne during 1862 amounted to 32,175 tons, and during 1863,
to 51,236 tons. Comparing this with the output for 1883—twenty
years later—it is found that the figures are more than
quadrupled, for in that year the output of the Tyne reached as
much as 216,600 tons.</p>

<p>In the year following the launch of the <i>John Bowes</i>, namely,
in 1853, the first iron vessel built on the Wear, was released
from its blocks. The Tees followed the example with great
energy and considerable success, and on both these rivers trade
in iron shipbuilding has been correspondingly developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>What may be described, however, as the opening of the age
of iron on the Wear did not begin till the year 1863. During
that year 17,720 tons of iron shipping were launched, and from
that time the declension of wood shipbuilding, which had long
made the Wear a distinguished shipbuilding port in the United
Kingdom, proceeded apace. The causes of fluctuation in the
trade throughout the subsequent years cannot be traced with
any circumstantiality, but the general progress made can be
readily gathered from the subjoined tabular record of the
number of ships built yearly, with their aggregate and average
tonnage. Wood vessels, it may be stated, formed part of the
aggregate till the year 1878, when wood dropped out of the
arena altogether:—</p>

<p class="p2">During the years 1871, 1872, and 1873 the output from the
Clyde yards averaged 50 per cent. of the total shipping produced
throughout the United Kingdom. That high proportion
fell for the years 1874, 1875, and 1876 to as low as 37½ per
cent. In 1882 the Clyde’s contribution to the grand total did
not exceed 32½ per cent., so that in one decade the premier
shipbuilding centre has fallen from the proud position of
producing half the total shipping built within the United
Kingdom to that of turning out less than one-third. Mr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
William Denny, dealing with this subject in a paper on
the “Industries of Scotland,” read before the Philosophical
Society of Dumbarton, in December, 1878, attributed the
then condition of affairs with regard to the tonnage output
of the Clyde to the keen competition of the builders on the
North-East Coast of England, who managed to produce their
favourite type of heavy-carrying, slow-speed steamers at very
much less cost than could be done on the Clyde. Their
success in this he attributed to four causes—1st, to the enterprise
of the small shipowners and the general public on the
North-East Coast of England in supplying capital for steamers
of this kind; 2nd, to the great cheapness of iron in that district;
3rd, to the long hours worked, enabling the shipbuilding plant
to be more profitably employed, and to the great development
of piece-work; 4th, to the fact that all the builders being
engaged upon work of the same class, the price of which could
be measured per ton of dead-weight carried, or per ton gross,
and per nominal horse-power, they were able easily to compare
the efficiency of each other’s yard in point of production, and
by that means a keen competition was produced amongst each
other. On the Clyde the great variety and frequent speciality
of the work prevented any such common measure of prices
existing. This way of accounting for the altered relative positions
of the chief shipbuilding centres was doubtless at that
time the correct one, and to a large extent it still holds true.
The productiveness of the North-East Coast ports has in no
way declined since, notwithstanding that a larger number of
the higher class passenger ships which have long been so much
a Clyde speciality are now being constructed there. But the
number of yards everywhere have increased in a higher ratio
than on the Clyde, and consequently the aggregate of new
shipping produced annually in the United Kingdom is made
up of a greater number of separate contributions. That this
is mainly the reason of the present position of the Clyde relatively
to the whole United Kingdom is proved by the figures
contained in the accompanying table, which show, amongst other
things, that the ratio of tonnage produced by each of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
districts to the total produced by the whole of them,
has not very much altered during the past six years, or since
Mr Denny spoke on the subject. If anything, indeed, the
Clyde shows in this respect an advance over its northern
rivals: although the advance of the Wear during the past two
years is equally marked.</p>

<p class="p1">With respect to the progress of shipbuilding in steel, little
requires to be added to the general account given in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>.
The tonnage annually produced in steel is a constantly-increasing
quantity. Hitherto the Clyde has contributed quite three-fourths
of the tonnage of steel vessels, owing chiefly to the
vigorous way in which certain of the shipbuilders there have
adopted the practice, and also to the openness of the local field
for the extensive manufacture of the new material. The North-East
Coast, however, bids fair, in the immediate future, to
become as productive in steel tonnage as the Clyde district.
Recently-discovered processes by which the vast stores of
Cleveland ironstone may be made profitably available in steel
manufacture are working great changes in the way of modifying
old and causing the erection of new works.</p>

<p>The extraordinary growth of steel shipbuilding since its
commencement in 1878 is well illustrated by the accompanying
tables, which are taken from a paper by Mr W. John, on
“Recent Improvements in Iron and Steel Shipbuilding,” read
at the meetings of the Iron and Steel Institute in May of the
present year. The figures relating to steel may be taken,
where any divergence occurs, as more authoritative than those
occurring in the general account of work in steel in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>.
The tables, however, partake of the imperfections already fully
alluded to in the present chapter. With regard to them, Mr
John says:—“Unfortunately, neither of these tables show the
actual amount of shipping, either steel or iron, built in this
country, because there would have to be a small percentage,
perhaps between ten and twenty, to be added to those classed
at Lloyds on Table I. for unclassed ships, and there would be
a certain proportion, which I am unable to ascertain, to be
added to the figures on Table II. for ships built for foreign
owners in this country, and not entered upon the British
register. However, the figures in themselves are sufficiently
significant of the enormous growth of steel shipbuilding within
the last six years, and it will be seen at once, as I have said
before, that steel as a material for shipbuilding has passed
entirely out of the experimental stage, and must be judged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
henceforth by the results of its working in the shipyards, and
by the results of the performances of the ships already afloat,
both as profit-earning machines for their owners, by their
general wear and tear, for their safety against strains at sea,
and in cases of collision and stranding.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PRODUCTION OF LARGE STEAMSHIPS.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Apart from the enormous aggregates, no feature of the
annual output of new tonnage during recent years has
been more remarkable than the great number of full-powered
and capacious steamships built for the various ocean-trading
companies. The very general interest with which what has
been termed “the race for big ships” was regarded two or three
years ago has now settled down into the complacent indifference
with which matter-of-fact, every-day things are treated.
The number of vessels above 4000 tons gross register built
during the year 1881 alone was over two-thirds of the whole
number produced during the ten years immediately preceding,
and was exactly double the number built during the previous
five years. From these general facts it may be understood why
the constant additions made to the “leviathans of the deep”
excite comparatively so little interest, except where matters of
dimension or mere bulk are supplemented by questions of
exceptional speed or novel construction.</p>

<p>The subjoined table of steamships above 4000 tons gross
register presently afloat or being constructed affords information
interesting from several such standpoints; and shows in
what years the product of big ships has been greatest, as well
as what proportion of individual credit falls to the various
centres engaged in their production. The vessels are arranged
in the order of their tonnages, which in every case available is
the gross register tonnage. While most of the information conveyed
in the table is such as may be gathered separately from
the registries, the form in which it has been compiled, and the
fact of the moulded in place of the registered dimensions being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
given, makes it valuable for reference. Except in a few instances,
where it was impossible to obtain them, the dimensions
of the vessels have been supplied by the respective builders.</p>

<p>Before presenting the table, several of the most noteworthy
features of the information it conveys may be pointed to. The
list comprises no fewer than 138 vessels, 50 of which are constructed
of steel. The year 1881 occurs twenty-six times in
the subjoined table, that number of vessels over 4000 tons
having been turned out within the year. As already stated,
this number is over two-thirds the total number for the ten
years immediately preceding 1881, and is exactly double the
number for the preceding five years. The year 1882 occurs
twenty-four times, the year 1883 fifteen times, and the present
year—although, of course, subject to possible additions—twenty-one
times.</p>

<p>The following summary gives the number of vessels of the
“leviathan” order launched in each year since 1858—the year
which witnessed the production of the <i>Great Eastern</i>—an
achievement as regards size which has not hitherto been
equalled:—</p>

<p>The column giving the districts in which the vessels have
been built, shows—what doubtless is already well recognised—that
the Clyde is supreme in this quantitative aspect of
steamship production. That river occurs seventy-nine times
in the table, a number equivalent to 57 per cent. of the total
of all the centres put together. Barrow follows next in order,
but with the relatively insignificant contribution of twelve—although
it is worthy of note that this contribution is entirely
made up by the vessels of one firm: <em>i.e.</em>, the Barrow Shipbuilding
Company—the Mersey contributes eleven, the Tyne ten,
and the other districts correspondingly lower numbers.</p>

<span class="fs80">CALCULATING INSTRUMENTS.</span></h2>


<p>The instruments to which references are made in Chapter
IV. as having come into use in some of our leading mercantile
shipyards by which the calculations undertaken there are
rendered greatly more simple, and are more expeditiously
made, seem not to be generally known amongst shipbuilders,
and as they undoubtedly save much of the labour and time
of calculation, without any sacrifice of accuracy, illustrations
of them are here given, together with brief notes of their
construction and use. For anything, however, like a satisfactory
account of the mathematical principles on which these
several instruments are based, readers must consult the authoritative
sources to which references will be made.</p>

<p>Assuming that the reader appreciates the advantages of
shortened calculation, due to the slide rule, or the use of
logarithms, the first instrument that may be noticed is one
embodying an application of the principle of the slide rule in
a remarkably handy and compact form. This is the calculating
slide rule invented by Professor Fuller, of Queen’s College,
Belfast, equivalent to a straight slide rule 83 feet 4 inches
long, or a circular rule 13 feet 3 inches in diameter. From
the illustration given it may be seen that the rule consists of
a cylinder which can be moved up and down upon, and turned
round, an axis, which is held by a handle. Upon this cylinder
is wound spirally a single logarithmic scale. Fixed to the
handle of the instrument is an index. Two other indices,
whose distance apart is the axial length of the complete spiral,
are fixed to an inner cylinder, which slides in like a telescope
tube, and thus enables the operator to place these indices in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
any required position relative to the outer cylinder containing
the logarithmic scale. Two stops—one on the fixed and the
other on the outer or movable cylinder—are so placed that
when they are brought in contact the index points to the commencement
of the scale.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">FULLER’S RULE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Regarding the manner of using the instrument a few general
notes may be given. As in the ordinary slide rule the operations
of multiplication and division are performed by the addition
or subtraction of the parts of the scale that represent
in length the logarithm of the numbers
involved in the operations.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the following calculation
is to be worked out</p>

<p>To do this in the ordinary way would keep the
smartest arithmetician busy for a considerable
time, whereas by means of the instrument under
notice the result is attained in little over one
minute’s time. The motions in the operation
are as follows:—Hold the rule by the handle in
one hand and move the scale cylinder by the
other until the number 6248 is opposite the index
attached to the handle portion. Now, move the
inner cylinder (by the top) until one or other of
the indices (according to the distance of the
number from the bottom of the instrument) on
the index arm is opposite the number 7963. The
scale cylinder is again moved till the number
5936 is opposite one of the indices just referred
to, and the inner cylinder carrying the index arm is then
moved till one or other of the indices is opposite 4851.
Finally, the scale cylinder is moved till the number 4217 is
opposite one of the indices on the arm; and the result of the
whole operation—4049—is found opposite the index first-mentioned,
<em>i.e.</em>, that attached to the handle portion of the
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>It may be further explained that the sliding of the scale
cylinder until the new number is opposite the index point
really involves two operations: one sliding it till the end of
the scale is opposite the index point—which subtracts the
logarithm of the divisor; and the other sliding it till the next
multiplier is opposite the index point—which adds its logarithm
to the previous result. Hence, when the operations
end with division the scale cylinder must be moved till the
end of the scale is opposite the index point.</p>

<p>The second scientific instrument to be noticed is the Polar
Planimeter, invented by M. J. Amsler-Laffon, Schaffhausen,
Switzerland, the object of which is to find the area of any
figure by simply tracing the outline with a pointer, the instrument—of
which the pointer is a part—doing all the rest; the
results read off from it having to undergo only a very simple
and elementary calculation to attain the desired result.</p>

its means the areas of, say, cross sections of ship’s hull can be
ascertained in an extremely short time and with almost perfect
accuracy, the readings taken from the instrument having simply
to be multiplied by a multiplier consisting of the square of the
number of units to the inch, corresponding to the scale on
which the sections are drawn, as 4 for ½-inch scale, 16 for ¼-inch,
64 for ⅛-inch, etc.</p>

<p>The Planimeter shown by Fig. 26 is the instrument in a form
adaptable to various scales, but does not possess any very
marked advantages over the simpler form for the purposes of
the naval architect or marine engineer, so that notice of it must
be brief. In this form of the instrument the unit can be changed
by altering the length of the arm which carries the tracer to
any of the scales for which the instrument may be made available,
and which are found divided upon the variable arm. The
scales which are usually provided for are as follows:—</p>

<p>Describing the simple planimeter more in detail, and referring
to Fig. 25, it may be said the outline of the figure to be
dealt with is travelled round by a pointer attached to a bar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
moving on a vertical axis carried by another bar, which latter
turns on a needle point slightly pressed into the drawing surface.
The bar with the pointer is provided with a revolving
drum having a graduated circumference and a disc counting its
revolutions. The drum is divided into 100 parts, reading into
a vernier, which gives the reading of the drum’s revolution to
the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> part of its circumference. Upon the same axis as the
drum an endless screw is cut, working into a worm wheel of
ten teeth connected with the counting disc, which records the
revolutions of the drum.</p>

<p>To use the planimeter, place the instrument upon the paper
so that the tracing point, roller, and needle point, all touch the
surface at any convenient position. Press the needle point
down gently, so that it just enters the paper, and place the small
weight supplied with the instrument over it. Make a mark at
any part of the outline of the figure to be computed, and set the
tracing point to it. Before commencing read off the counting
wheel and the index roller. Suppose the counting wheel marks
2, the roller index 91, and the vernier 5, then, the unit in this
case being 10 sq. ins., write this down 29·15 (for the proportional
or variable-scale planimeter this reading would be 2·915.)
Follow with the tracing point exactly the outline of the figure to
be measured in the direction of the movement of the hands of
a watch, until you arrive at the starting point; now read the
instrument. Suppose this reading to be 47·67, then by deducting
the first reading (29·15) the remainder (18·52) indicates that
the measured area contains 18·52 units—i.e., square inches—which
is the final result, so far as the instrument is concerned.
To obtain the actual area in feet, however, this result must be
multiplied by the number before explained corresponding to
the scale on which the figure that has been measured is drawn.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Assuming the scale to have been ¼-inch per foot, then 18·52
inches multiplied by 16—the appropriate multiplier for that
scale—gives 296·32 square feet, the exact area.</p>

<p>Several important points remain to be noticed in connection
with the use of the instrument. As a rule, the areas to be
measured in connection with ship designing are on a small
scale, and the fixed or needle point about which the instrument
moves can always be placed <em>outside</em> the figure measured,
in which case the process remains as above stated. It should
be mentioned, however, that by placing the needle point <em>inside</em>
the figure, in such a position as to enable the operator to follow
its contour a larger figure can be measured at one operation—the
reading, however, being less than the true area by a
constant number which varies slightly with the construction
of each instrument, and which is found engraved on the small
weight already referred to (on the top of the bar in the
proportional planimeter). Adding this constant number to
any reading taken by the instrument placed as described, gives
the true area.</p>

<p>The counting disc may go through more than one revolution
forwards or backwards. If the needle point be <em>outside</em> the
figure traversed the counting disc can only move <em>forwards</em> (as
9, 0, 1, 2, &amp;c.): that is, provided the figure has been traced in
the manner directed—in the direction of the hands of a watch.
Then as many times as the zero mark passes the index line
add 10·000 to the <em>second</em> reading. If the needle point be <em>inside</em>
the figure, the disc can move either forwards or backwards. If
moving backwards, as 2, 1, 0, 9, &amp;c., then add 10·000 to the
<em>first</em> reading.</p>

<p>Before passing from the subject of the planimeter it may be
both interesting and useful to give an example of a calculation
involving its use. Subjoined is a specimen displacement and
longitudinal centre of buoyancy calculation, and any one
familiar with the prodigious array of columns and figures pertaining
to a “displacement sheet” of the ordinary kind cannot
fail to appreciate the advantages of the specimen, both with
respect to simplicity of arrangement and curtailment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
amount of calculation ordinarily involved:—</p>

<p class="p1">The integrator, another and still more ingenious instrument,
by M. J. Amsler-Laffon, was invented theoretically shortly after
<ins class="corr" id="tn-213" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the plainimeter just'">
the planimeter just</ins> described (in the year 1855), but was first
constructed for practical use in the year 1867, the first instrument
made being exhibited in the Paris International Exhibition
in the year named. It was not introduced into England till the
year 1878, and although adapted for other uses than those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
involved in scientific calculations connected with shipbuilding
it was in this connection that attention was first seriously
directed towards it. In 1880 the late Mr C. W. Merrifield
described the instrument, and traced the mathematical principles
upon which it is based, before the Institution of Naval
Architects, and in 1882, before the same body, Mr J. H. Biles,
naval architect for the firm of Messrs J. &amp; G. Thomson, called
attention to the usefulness of the instrument in stability
investigations, showing by specimen calculations and other
particulars its great adaptability to this class of work, even
in the hands of youthful and untrained operators. A still
more recent and exhaustive paper devoted to the claims of the
integrator upon naval architects was read before the same
Institution by Dr A. Amsler, the son of the inventor, at its
last meeting. This paper was chiefly concerned with demonstrating
the advantages of the integrator in respect of time
saved, as well as in respect of its great accuracy.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/fig27.jpg" alt="Machine to calculate area and moments">
  <figcaption class="caption">AMSLER’S MECHANICAL INTEGRATOR.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The object of the integrator is to find at one operation the
area, the statical moment, and the moment of inertia of any
closed curve or figure by simply tracing out the curve with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
pointer, the results being read off directly from the instrument,
as in the case of the planimeter, and with a correspondingly
small amount of after calculation. As shown by Fig. 25, the
essential parts of the integrator are a rail <b>L</b>, having groove with
which to guide the wheels <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> of a carriage provided with
rollers <b>D<sub>1</sub></b> <b>D<sub>2</sub></b> <b>D<sub>3</sub></b> moving on the surface of the drawing. The
contour of the figure to be dealt with is traced—in the direction
of the movement of the hands of a watch—by the pointer <b>F</b>,
this pointer being attached to an arm moving on the vertical
centre of the instrument while the whole mechanism runs to and
fro on the rail <b>L</b>. Under these conditions the rollers
<b>D<sub>1</sub></b> <b>D<sub>2</sub></b> <b>D<sub>3</sub></b>
execute movements partly rolling, partly sliding, and by readings
taken from the divisions engraved upon their circumferences at
the beginning and the end of the whole movement, together
with simple arithmetical processes, the nature of which may
be inferred from the explanations given of the planimeter
readings, the three quantities sought are arrived at.</p>

<p class="p4b">In a valuable appendix to the paper read by Dr Amsler,
before the Institution of Naval Architects, specimen sheets are
given of several calculations, of a vessel of about 4000 tons, the
forms in which the figures are entered being so arranged as to
avoid all unnecessary trouble in measuring and calculating, and
to contain at the same time a check on the results. The accuracy
and the speed of working depend, of course, to a considerable
extent on the person using the integrator, but as showing what
can be obtained with the instrument after some practice, the
specimens given in the paper referred to are certainly remarkable.
For the calculations of the data necessary for the
construction of the curves of displacement and vertical position
of centre of buoyancy, the complete integrator and arithmetical
work took only two hours; for the data requisite for the curve
of displacement per inch immersion, and transverse metacentre
one hour was taken; and for the complete calculation, affording
data to construct a stability curve, the time taken was only
eight hours. A similar calculation done in the ordinary arithmetical
method, and giving results far less reliable, would have
taken as many days. All the work, it should be added, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
done without the aid of an assistant. Amongst other calculations
besides displacement and stability in connection with
which the integrator is greatly advantageous, are those concerned
with the strength of vessels and with the longitudinal
strains to which they are subject at sea through unequal
distributions of weight and buoyancy, already fully referred
to in the chapter on scientific progress.</p>

which all others are made subservient, is <em>safety</em>. First-class vessels,
unstinted equipment, carefully-selected officers and men, combined
with close personal supervision, are the means used to attain this
end, and that it is attained marvellously is matter of world-wide
fame. Apart from his able management of the Cunard fleet, Mr
<span class="smcap">Burns</span> has not allowed the affairs of his Home Services between
this country and Ireland and elsewhere, to suffer in any particular,
but in his hands these concerns have flourished and the trade greatly
increased. The services are conducted by a splendid fleet of mail
steamers, now belonging exclusively to Mr <span class="smcap">Burns</span>, quite irrespective
of the Cunard fleet, and which, for speed, safety, and unfailing regularity
of departure and arrival, are probably unsurpassed. As
representing the Cunard Company, and also as a private shipowner,
Mr <span class="smcap">Burns</span> has taken frequent and conspicuous part in the
discussion of those great matters which concern the maritime interests
of this country. Has often been called upon to give evidence
before Select Committees of the House of Commons on shipping
affairs. Was amongst the first to recommend to Government the
desirability of fitting merchant steamships so as to be available in
times of war. Is Deputy-Lieutenant of Lanarkshire, and Magistrate
for the counties of Lanark and Renfrew. Evinces unbounded interest
in the commercial and social well-being of his native city, numerous
benevolent institutions in great measure owing their existence to his
hearty munificence. His residence of Castle Wemyss, on the Clyde,
is frequently the abode of the famous of this and other countries.</p>

<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at Campbeltown, Argyleshire, in 1830, and educated at the
Grammar School of that town. In 1845 removed to Glasgow,
and in 1847 entered the counting-house of Mr George Gillespie,
where he was chiefly employed in connection with the Allan Line
service of clipper ships between Glasgow and Canada, for which
trade Mr Gillespie was then agent. In 1853 transferred his services
to the Allan Line firm, where, for several years, was principal
clerk and cashier, subsequently becoming partner. During the
year 1853 the Messrs Allan resolved to add a fleet of steamers
to their already well-known line of clipper ships, and contracted
for the building of four screw vessels, the first of which—the
<i>Canadian</i>—was launched in July, 1854. The growth of the business
may be inferred from the fact that the Allan fleet at the present
time consists of twenty-eight steamers, of 87,078 tons, and fifteen
sailing vessels, of 21,225 tons. Mr <span class="smcap">Dunlop</span>, since joining the firm,
has taken an active part, along with Mr Alexander Allan, its senior
member, in the building arrangements of the Allan Line. When
mild steel was beginning to take the place of iron in the construction
of steamers, and before any of the Atlantic companies had ventured
on its use, Mr <span class="smcap">Dunlop</span> and his partners evinced ready confidence in
the new material, their adoption of it being elsewhere referred to in
this work. From an early period Mr <span class="smcap">Dunlop</span> has taken an active
interest in shipping legislation. In 1874 gave evidence before the
Select Committee of the House of Commons upon the Measurement
of Tonnage Bill, and again in 1882 before the Royal Commission on
the same subject. During the Plimsoll agitation, and the consideration
of the proposed legislation resulting from it, was a witness before
the Select Committee of the House. In 1879 was deputed by the
Shipowners Association of Glasgow to give evidence before the Select
Committee upon the Merchant Seamen Bill then before the House.
In connection with Mr Chamberlain’s recent efforts at legislation on
Merchant Shipping, issued a pamphlet which very fully discussed
the questions raised, and exhibited an analysis of the losses of life in
merchant shipping. Gave evidence during the present year before
the Load Line Committee, on which body Mr <span class="smcap">Dunlop</span> had been invited
to serve; business duties, however, preventing him accepting.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mr Thomas Henderson, senior member of the firm of Henderson
Bros., managing owners of the Anchor Line of Steamships, is a
native of Fifeshire, but was educated in Glasgow. He entered,
at an early age, the mercantile marine service as an apprentice,
and rapidly rose through the different grades of the profession
to the command of various sailing ships and steamers belonging
to the port of Glasgow. In 1853 he was admitted a partner
in the shipping firm of Handyside, &amp; Co., which, five years
afterwards, was changed to Handyside &amp; Henderson. Some years
later, on the retirement of the Messrs Handyside and the assumption
of Mr John Henderson and other partners into the business, the
firm became Henderson Brothers, under which designation the greater
part of the steam shipping business now carried on by the Anchor
Line steamships has been developed and extended. The fleet as
now constituted consists of forty-five steamships of an aggregate
measurement of over 124,000 tons, with an engine power of
above 25,000 horses nominal. These vessels are employed severally
in the Transatlantic, Indian, and Mediterranean services, in
all of which they are well known and appreciated by the public as
in all respects first-class, and second to no other competing line for
safety, speed, comfort to passengers, and careful delivery of goods
carried. One branch of the extensive services of the Anchor steamships,
specially noteworthy as forming one of the modern “express”
lines which have given such impetus to ocean travel,
is the express service between Liverpool and New York, in
which the magnificent steamships <i>City of Rome</i> and <i>Austral</i> are
engaged. In connection with their head office in Glasgow, Messrs
Henderson Bros. have established branch offices of their own in
London, Liverpool, Manchester, Barrow-in-Furness, Queenstown,
Londonderry, Dundee, New York, Boston, Chicago, Paris, Marseilles,
and Palermo, at all of which the agency business of the several lines
of steamers is attended to by their own employees. In addition to
his responsible share in the concerns of the Anchor Line, Mr <span class="smcap">Henderson</span>
is a partner in the extensive shipbuilding and engineering
works of D. &amp; W. Henderson &amp; Co., at Meadowside, Partick, and
Finnieston Quay, Glasgow. The estimation in which Mr <span class="smcap">Henderson</span>
is held as a shipping and commercial authority may be inferred
from the enumeration of important offices at the head of this note;
most of which he has worthily occupied for many years.</p>

MEMBER OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE, AND OF THE INSTITUTION
OF ENGINEERS AND SHIPBUILDERS IN SCOTLAND.</p>

<hr class="r5a">
<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at Brompton, in Kent, in the year 1835. Learned practical
shipbuilding in Her Majesty’s Dockyard at Chatham, and was at
the same time engaged in the office of the master shipwright there,
the late celebrated Mr Oliver Lang. When the Government in 1861
determined upon the construction of iron ships in the Royal
Dockyards, was the first officer selected to carry on that work, and
superintended the building of H.M. <i>Achilles</i> in the dockyard
at Chatham. In 1863 left the Government service to become a
Surveyor to Lloyd’s Registry in the Clyde district, and in 1864 was
appointed General Manager in Messrs R. Napier &amp; Sons’ shipbuilding
establishment, where, in 1865, his ability as a naval architect
was first brought into prominence through the designing of the
<i>Pereire</i> and <i>Ville De Paris</i>, built for the Compagnie General Transatlantique,
which vessels maintained for several years a foremost
place amongst the fast ships on the Atlantic. After the death of
Mr John Elder, in 1869, joined by request the late Messrs John Ure
and J. L. K. Jamieson in carrying on and extending the gigantic
shipbuilding and engineering business at Fairfield, under the title
of John Elder &amp; Co. In 1878 Mr Ure and Mr Jamieson retired
from the firm, and Mr <span class="smcap">Pearce</span> became sole partner, which position
he has occupied up to the present time. Has constructed many
steamships that are amongst the most celebrated <ins class="corr" id="tn-b1" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'in existance, of'">
in existence, of</ins> which it may suffice simply to name the <i>Arizona</i>, <i>Alaska</i>, and
<i>Oregon</i>; the <i>Orient</i>, <i>Austral</i>, and <i>Stirling Castle</i>; also the <i>Umbria</i>
and <i>Etruria</i>, just being completed for the Cunard Steamship Company.
Another vessel built by Mr <span class="smcap">Pearce</span>, the construction of
which excited, perhaps, a greater amount of interest than any of
the above named, was the yacht <i>Livadia</i>, for the late Emperor of
Russia. The design, which was a fantastic one, was by Admiral Popoff.
Mr <span class="smcap">Pearce’s</span> enterprize has not been confined to shipbuilding and
engineering, having projected or become largely interested in several
lines of steamers, amongst which are, the Pacific Mail Steamship
Co.; the New Zealand Shipping Company; the Guion Line; and
the China Line of the Scottish Oriental Steamship Company. In
1880 Mr <span class="smcap">Pearce</span> gave the opening lecture in the course delivered in
connection with the Marine Exhibition held in the Corporation Buildings,
Glasgow. In 1881 was appointed a member of the Royal Commission
on Tonnage, and in October of the present year was appointed
a member of the Royal Commission on Merchant Shipping.</p>

<hr class="r5a">
<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, on 17th May, 1811, his family
then being—and having been since 1780—extensively engaged in
shipowning and shipbuilding there. Removed to London in 1831,
and entered the counting-house of Mr James Thomson, a considerable
shipowner, whose vessels were principally engaged in the West
Indian trade. Assumed partnership with Mr Thomson in 1847,
carrying on business as James Thomson &amp; Co., a connection which,
unfortunately, was soon thereafter broken, in the removal by death
of Mr Thomson. In 1849 the business was extended to the Australian
trade, by the commencement of a line of sailing vessels to Adelaide,
which soon became well-known and favourite traders. Some time
after Mr Thomson’s death, the name of the firm was changed to
Anderson, Thomson &amp; Co., and in 1869 it underwent a second change
to Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co., its present designation. In 1876 the
feasibility of running a direct line of steamships to Australia occurred
to Mr <span class="smcap">Anderson</span> and his partners, and was practically tested at their
sole risk in that year. Notwithstanding the predictions that severe
loss would result, the experiments encouraged Messrs Anderson,
Anderson &amp; Co. to promote the formation of a company to work such
a service. Early in 1877, Messrs F. Green &amp; Co. joined Messrs
Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co. in the enterprize, and on the 7th March,
1878, the steamer <i>Garonne</i> left England for Australia, flying the flag
of the <span class="smcap">Orient Steam Navigation Co., Limited</span>, the designation
“Orient” having been adopted through the high reputation of the
clipper ship of that name belonging to Messrs Anderson, Anderson
&amp; Co. Anticipations were at first confined to the hope that sufficient
trade might be found to justify monthly sailings, but almost at once
it was seen that a fortnightly service was requisite. At the outset
four steamers—the <i>Chimborazo</i>, <i>Lusitania</i>, <i>Cuzco</i>, and <i>Garonne</i>—were
purchased by the Company, and one—the <i>Orient</i>—built. In January,
1880, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company entered, as it were, into
partnership, by supplying, in ready and admirable working order, the
additional vessels required. The further additions to the fleet, and
the nature of the service done, are referred to elsewhere in this work.</p>

London to Bathgate as manager of Young’s Parafin Oil Works,
first at Bathgate and then at West Calder, during which period
he introduced many improvements in the apparatus employed,
notably in shale breaking and cooling machinery. About 1870

<hr class="r5a">
<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born in Glasgow in 1842, where his father, Mr Anthony Inglis, and
Mr John Inglis, his uncle, were marine engineers, subsequently also
becoming iron shipbuilders. Under the designation of A. &amp; J. Inglis
the combined businesses—the engineering works at Warroch
Street, and the shipyard at Pointhouse—have been conducted
with marked success. Having for some years attended the Glasgow
Academy, Mr <span class="smcap">Inglis</span>, at the age of fifteen, entered the University,
where for several sessions he studied under such teachers
as the late Professors Ramsay, Blackburn, and Rankine, and also
under Sir William Thomson. Of Professor Blackburn’s mathematical
and Professor Rankine’s engineering classes Mr <span class="smcap">Inglis</span> was a distinguished
student; in the former—although the youngest on the roll—carrying
off several prizes, and in the latter acquiring a sound
knowledge of applied mathematics as concerned with engineering and
naval architecture. This experience was afterwards supplemented
by a term’s apprenticeship in the practical work of the engine shop.
The art of naval construction, however, had always irresistible attraction
for Mr <span class="smcap">Inglis</span>, and in 1867 he seriously applied himself to
the concerns of the shipyard, taking an active share in its management
ever since. Mr <span class="smcap">Inglis’</span> career, though uneventful, has been
one of assiduous devotion to the profession of Naval Architecture,
especially as directed to scientific investigation and analysis. The
fruits of this are reflected in many noteworthy and specialized steam
vessels produced by his firm. Was the first shipbuilder on the Clyde
to follow the practice of inclining vessels to ascertain their stability,
and was one of the earliest on the Clyde to apply the correct method
of estimating longitudinal strains to the hulls of steamers. His firm
have been noted for the careful and elaborate trials of steamers on
the measured mile, and the digesting of such data. Is the author of
several papers read before the societies with which he is connected,
one of which fully described the system of speed trial and analysis
above referred to. The designing and sailing of yachts are favourite
pursuits of Mr <span class="smcap">Inglis</span>; and the system of yacht ballasting by means
of a lead keel forming portion of the hull structure was first instituted
by him in one of the many yachts built for his own use. Under the
title of “A Yachtsman’s Holidays,” he published, some years ago,
a volume giving a racy account of yachting experiences in the West
Hebrides. He wields a forcible pen, and it is not unfrequently employed

<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at Sheerness, September 20th, 1830. Educated at the School
of Mathematics and Naval Construction, Portsmouth, and served
in the Royal Dockyard, Sheerness. Leaving the Government service,
he became the editor of the “Mechanics’ Magazine,” in which position
he first became known as an authority on Naval Architecture.
Was one of the originators of the Institution of Naval Architects in
1860, and for a number of years acted as Secretary to that body.
Submitted proposals to the Admiralty concerning the construction of
iron-clad ships, which were adopted in practice, and were so highly
approved by the Board of Admiralty that their author was appointed
Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy in 1863. During the time he
held that office, designed iron-clad ships and vessels of war of every
class for the British Navy, and also—with the consent of the Government—some
iron-clad frigates for the Turkish Navy. In consequence
of his objections to rigged sea-going turret ships with low freeboard,
of the “Captain” class, and of the favour that type of ship found with
the Board of Admiralty, resigned his office in July, 1870—a step rendered
remarkably significant by the lamentable capsizing of the
“Captain” two months later. Since his resignation, has designed
iron-clad vessels and other classes of war ships for various Foreign
Powers; numerous steam yachts, and smaller vessels. Has recently
devised and patented a method of construction for war ships which
will reduce to a minimum the destructive effect of marine torpedoes,
and which promises to revolutionise present structural systems. Is the
author of “Shipbuilding in Iron and Steel,” “Our Iron-clad Ships,”
“Our Naval Coast Defences,” “Japan: Its History, Traditions, and Religions,”
as well as of several papers contributed to the Institutions
with which he is connected. Since his retirement from the Admiralty
has received numerous recognitions of his professional skill and ability,
including various decorations from Foreign Powers. Was created a
Knight Commander of the Bath, in 1880. In 1874 was returned to
Parliament in the Liberal interest as Member for the Pembroke
Boroughs, which he represented till 1880, when he was elected for
the important constituency of Cardiff. During the summer of 1883
was deputed by the Government to investigate and report upon the
“Daphne” catastrophe on the Clyde, the results of which are elsewhere
referred to in this work. In February of the present year was
entrusted with the Presidency of the Committee appointed to enquire
into the subject of the Load Line of vessels.</p>

<hr class="r5a">
<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at Portsmouth in 1845. Received a preliminary training
in practical shipbuilding, and in the drawing office, at the Royal
Dockyard, Portsmouth, and studied in the Mathematical School there.
Was appointed an admiralty student in the Royal School of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering, South Kensington, in 1864.
In 1867 was a draughtsman and assistant surveyor, in the Admiralty
Service, and in 1870 was foreman of the Royal Dockyard, Portsmouth.
Left the Admiralty Service at the end of 1871 to become the principal
assistant of Sir E. J. Reed, K.C.B., M.P., in the designing and surveying
of war-ships, building for various Governments. In 1874
was general manager of Earle’s Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company
at Hull. From 1876 to 1879 practised as a naval architect in London;
and in 1879 went to Japan, by request of the Imperial Japanese
Government, to advise upon matters relating to their navy. In 1880
visited the principal arsenals and workshops of China, and returned
to this country in 1881. Since then has practised in London as a
Consulting Naval Architect and Engineer, and designed and superintended
the construction of numerous vessels. At the request of the
builders and owners respectively, investigated the causes of the
disasters which befell the “Daphne” and “Austral,” and gave evidence
respecting the same at the official inquiries, held in 1883.
Immediately upon the “John Elder” Chair of Naval Architecture
being founded in Glasgow University, through the munificence of
Mrs Elder, the University Court unanimously elected Mr <span class="smcap">Elgar</span> as
the first Professor. In 1884 was nominated by the Council of the
Institution of Naval Architects as their representative upon the
Board of Trade Load Line Committee. Is the author of an illustrated
work upon “The Ships of the Royal Navy,” and of papers read before
the Royal Society and Institution of Naval Architects; and was
formerly sub-editor of the Quarterly Magazine “Naval Science.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Denny</span> was born at Dumbarton in 1847, and was educated at the
High School of Edinburgh, under the late Mr John Carmichael,
one of its most distinguished teachers. In his seventeenth year,
he left the High School, and entered on a course of practical training
as a shipbuilder in Leven Shipyard, serving for stated terms in
the various departments. Since 1870 he has been a partner, and of
late the managing partner, in the shipbuilding firm, and he has also
shared in the partnership of the separate engineering business of
Messrs Denny &amp; Company. In addition to discharging the many
arduous duties pertaining to his business position, Mr <span class="smcap">Denny</span> is
enabled to take a prominent part in the proceedings of several of the

<p class="noindent">Born at Narberth, Pembrokeshire, in July, 1845. Was educated in
the Mathematical School at the Royal Dockyard, Pembroke, and
received a practical training in shipbuilding in that dockyard. Was
appointed an Admiralty student in the Royal School of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering, South Kensington, in 1864,
and passed out in 1867 with the diploma of Fellow of the First
Class. In 1867 was appointed a draughtsman in the department of
the Controller of the Navy at the Admiralty, and served in that
capacity till 1872, when he left the Admiralty service for that of
Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign Shipping, in which Society
he was shortly afterwards appointed Assistant Chief Surveyor. In
1881 he left Lloyd’s Register to become general manager to the
Barrow Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. (Limited), at Barrow-in-Furness,
which position he now occupies. While at the Admiralty,
distinguished himself in original scientific work in naval architecture—notably
in 1868, by constructing the first curve of stability which
was ever produced; in 1870, by investigating the stability of H.M.S.
“Captain,” and pointing out, only a few days before she was lost,
the dangers to which she was liable; also by his calculations relating
to the strength of war-ships, and constructing for them the first
curves of hogging and sagging and sheering strains. Since leaving
the Admiralty, has enhanced his high reputation for scientific skill
through his investigations into the stability and strength of mercantile
ships, and the numerous valuable papers upon these and other
subjects, which he has read before the Institution of Naval Architects,
and other scientific bodies. Has devoted himself largely
and very successfully to the consideration of the principal causes
of loss of ships at sea—both of sailing vessels and steamers;
and has given most instructive evidence in some of the principal
cases which have been enquired into in recent years. Several years
ago, when sailing ships were being frequently dismasted, made
a very lengthy and complete investigation of the circumstances
in which these casualties happened, and of their causes; and the
same is embodied in an elaborate report upon the subject to the
Committee of Lloyd’s Register. Was selected by the Committee
appointed to enquire into the loss of H.M.S. Atalanta to investigate
the stability of that vessel as an independent check upon the
official Admiralty calculations, and his report and evidence showed
conclusively that she was capsizable, and probably did capsize at sea.</p>

<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent">Born at South Shields, on the Tyne, in 1822. Son of Mr George
Palmer, who was in early life engaged in Greenland whaling, and
was subsequently a merchant and shipowner at Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Was trained for a mercantile life, and having completed his education
in France, became, at an early age, partner with his
father in the firm of Palmer, Beckwith &amp; Co., export merchants,
timber merchants, and sawmill owners: a firm since styled Palmer,
Hall &amp; Co., and of which he is now the senior. In 1845 assumed
partnership with Mr John Bowes, the late Sir William Hutt, and the
late Mr Nicholas Wood, in the Marley Hill colliery and coke
manufacture, and subsequently acquiring <ins class="corr" id="tn-b4" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the colleries of'">
the collieries of</ins> Lord Ravensworth &amp; Partners, and of others, the concern known as John
Bowes, Esq. &amp; Partners, has become, under Mr Palmer’s sole
management, one of the largest colliery concerns in the north of
England. In 1852, in partnership at first with his elder brother
George, commenced iron shipbuilding at Jarrow, in which year they
launched the <i>John Bowes</i>, notable as the first screw collier. Through
gradual extension the works at Jarrow have become the great establishment
described in the body of this work. Many vessels of war have
been built by Mr <span class="smcap">Palmer’s</span> firm, and it was in the construction of
the iron-clad <i>Terror</i>, in their works, at the time of the Crimean war,
that rolled in place of forged armour plates were first used, the
superiority of the change—<ins class="corr" id="tn-b5" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'since universelly'">since
universally</ins> recognised—being then
experimentally demonstrated at considerable cost by Mr <span class="smcap">Palmer’s</span> firm.
Among other enterprises which owe their existence wholly or partially
to Mr <span class="smcap">Palmer</span> may be mentioned the General Iron Screw Collier
Company, the Tyne Steam Shipping Company, several of the great
lines of Atlantic and Mediterranean steamers, the Bede Metal Company,
the Tyne Plate Glass Company, and Insurance Clubs for
Steamers. In politics Mr <span class="smcap">Palmer</span> is a Liberal, and after unsuccessfully
contesting his native town in 1868 he was, in 1874, elected M.P.
for the northern division of Durham, a seat which he continues to
hold. His country residence is at Grinkle Park, in Cleveland, but
Parliamentary and other duties necessitate his being much in London,
where he has a town house. The interest he has taken in behalf of
the English shipowners has lately resulted in his appointment as one
of the new English directors of the Suez Canal.</p>

<hr class="r5a">
<div class="fs85">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr Laing</span> was born at Deptford House, Sunderland, on 11th January,
1823, and is the only son of Mr Philip Laing, who, as early as 1793,
in partnership with his brother John, commenced the business of
shipbuilding which, nearly a century later, is still carried on,
under greatly transformed conditions, by his son. Mr <span class="smcap">Laing’s</span>
earliest impressions and associations were connected with what
was afterwards to become his life’s vocation, his boyhood
having been spent in a home contiguous to his father’s yard.
While a youth, he served as an ordinary workman in the shipyard,
and in 1843, his father, on launching the “Cressy,” signalised the
jubilee of a singularly successful career by handing over to him
the care and titles of the business. Mr <span class="smcap">Laing</span> continued to build
wooden vessels until 1853, in which year the “Amity,” his first iron
ship, was launched. In 1866 he entirely ceased building in wood,
and since then has built a very large number of iron vessels for various
owners, amongst others for such well-known companies as the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the Royal
Mail Company, the Union Steamship Company of Southampton, etc.
In 1883, he built for the last-mentioned company the Mail Steamer
“Mexican,” of 4669 tons. Besides the shipyard, he is the owner
of graving docks connected therewith, as well as extensive copper
and brass works, and is principal proprietor of the Ayres Quay
Bottle Works, which are capable of turning out 33,000 bottles
per day. For upwards of thirty years Mr <span class="smcap">Laing</span> has served as
a member of the River Wear Commission, and as chairman since
1868. For years he has taken a leading position among shipbuilders
and shipowners, not only in his own district, but throughout the
country. In 1883 he was chosen President of the Chamber of Shipping
of the United Kingdom, and as official representative of that interest
has performed signal service, both with reference to the Shipping
Bill introduced to Parliament by Mr Chamberlain and the recent
agreement come to between the shipowners and the Suez Canal
Company, of which company he has since been appointed a
Director. For twenty years Mr <span class="smcap">Laing</span> has acted as a member of
the Board of Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, and at present is Vice-President
of the Load Line Committee, appointed by the Board of
Trade for the settlement of a most important and intricate question.
In the shipbuilding and other cognate businesses Mr <span class="smcap">Laing</span> is now
ably assisted by his three sons, Philip, Arthur, and James.</p>

considerable trouble in the hope that they may be of use to technical readers in
directing them at once to accurate and detailed information. In this connection
also, the excellent work by Mr A. S. Seaton, “Manual of Marine
Engineering,” and that by Mr W. H. White, “Manual of Naval Architecture,”
may be referred to with every satisfaction.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> For full and excellent treatment of this subject, see the paper on “Causes
of Unseaworthiness in Merchant Steamers,” by Mr Benjamin Martell, Chief
Surveyor to Lloyd’s Register, with the ensuing discussion: Trans. Inst., N.A.,
vol. xxi., 1880.</p>

<p>Several of the causes above named it is doubtless the province of the scientific
shipbuilder, and the duty of the shipowner, to obviate by furnishing the captain
and officers—especially in the case of entirely new vessels—with particulars and
data of the vessel’s technical character, such as are now left to be found out by
slow and sometimes bitter experience. Of these it may be sufficient to
instance:—Stability, steadiness, trim, carrying capability, and steaming powers.
Mr William Denny, of Dumbarton, has recently publicly declared his firm’s
intention of supplying such particulars to the vessels built by them. It is to
be hoped this worthy example may be extensively followed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> In this, as in other matters dealt with, the full appreciation of which involves
careful technical study, readers are referred to the papers enumerated at the
end of chapter, as well as to the “Manuals” already referred to in this work.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The principle which underlies the experiment is this:—If any one body
forming part of a system of heavy bodies be moved from one position
in the system to another, the weight of the body moved multiplied into
the distance through which it is moved, is precisely equal to the weight of
the whole system of bodies multiplied into the distance through which the
common centre of gravity of the whole has moved. If in a ship, therefore, a
movable weight of known amount is moved across the deck through a given
known distance, the centre of gravity of the ship itself, with all on board, has
been moved in a line parallel to that through which the small weight has been
transferred, and through a distance inversely proportioned to the weight of the
whole ship to the weight moved. If, for instance, a weight of five tons should
be moved through a distance of twenty feet, then multiplying this weight into
this distance and dividing by the total weight of the ship, the distance through
which the ship’s centre of gravity has travelled parallel to the deck is obtained.
If, at the same time, an exact measure of the angle through which the ship
has been inclined by moving the five tons through the distance named has been
taken, and the position of the ship’s metacentre has been obtained, then the
elements of a triangle are known—namely, the degrees in each of its angles,
and the length of one of the sides—and from these the length of the remaining
sides of the triangle is easily deduced. One of these sides will be the distance
between the metacentre of the ship and its centre of gravity, and, consequently,
the metacentre being known from calculation, the position of the centre of
gravity becomes known also.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The classification of strains here given is as contained in White’s “Manual
of Naval Architecture.” To this authoritative source readers must turn who
wish a full exposition of the several problems go shortly dealt with in these pages.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> This will be more fully referred to further on, but it may be stated here
that the need for independent calculation is largely obviated, owing to the
existence of “co-efficients,” deduced from investigations made by experts.
Further, the existence and influence of the Registration Societies are such that
the codes of scantling and the structural supervision instituted by them together
constitute the only guarantee of structural strength generally desiderated.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Suppose the dimensions of a proposed vessel to be 320 × 36 × 26½ feet,
then, according to a method of approximation largely in use, the sum of these
dimensions divided by 100 gives what is known as the “cubic number”—(320
× 36 × 26½ ÷ 100) = 3052 cubic number. Suppose that for a vessel already
built, similar in type and dimensions, or of similar proportions, to the one
proposed, the cubic number, when divided into the ship’s actual weight
(<em>i.e.</em>, the displacement <em>minus</em> the weight of machinery and the dead-weight
carried), gives say ·53, then this figure represents the “co-efficient” of ship’s
weight, and applying it in the case supposed gives:—3052 × ·53 = 1620, the
weight of hull for proposed vessel. This example illustrates the manner in
which the weight of machinery is estimated, and indicates the nature and use
of the general term “co-efficient:” frequently employed in this chapter.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> One such method, devised and followed by Mr C. Zimmermann in his daily
practice as chief draughtsman to the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, and described
by him before the Institution of Naval Architects in 1883, gives with
very little preliminary calculation, and at once, a close approximation to the
correct displacement. Another system, originated and used in practice by Mr
Chas. H. Johnson, chief designer to Messrs Wm. Denny &amp; Brothers, consists
of an analysis of the lines of vessels of various degrees of fineness and fulness
previously built, formulated for daily use in a series of curves of areas, giving,
for sections at certain fixed distances from midships—in terms of percentage to
the midship area—the particular area specially suited to afford the required displacement;
and at the same time to maintain the general form of hull which
in actual practice has proved satisfactory with respect to speed. In his later
practice, Mr Johnson has found it preferable to use the block form of analysis
of Mr A. C. Kirk (considered further on in matters relating to speed), using
the three sides of that form as a basis upon which to group the water-lines.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> This experimental method, it may be explained, has long been practised in
connection with ships built for the Royal Navy, and for a considerable number
of years it has been systematically followed in some leading merchant shipyards.
Messrs A. &amp; J. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow, and Messrs Wm. Denny &amp; Bros.,
Dumbarton, were amongst the earliest firms to systematically adopt the practice.
With the former it has been customary to incline every vessel of distinctive
type built by them since 1871, and with the latter the practice has been
constantly followed from a date somewhat subsequent. For some years past
other firms on the Clyde and elsewhere have adopted the method, the data
so accumulated being found an admirable basis from which to estimate the
height of the centre of gravity in proposed vessels. Tables giving the results of
inclining experiments made on various types of merchant steamships and sailing
vessels will be found in “White’s Manual of Naval Architecture,” pages 82-87.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> From the first volume (1860) of the Transactions of the Institution of Naval
Architects, it is seen that Dr Inman, Samuel Read, and Dr Woolley had each
already found different methods of simplifying Atwood’s calculations.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Various other methods of simplifying the calculations based on Atwood’s
theorem were subsequently proposed, and one or two different methods also
brought forward—notably one in 1876 by the late Mr Charles W. Merrifield,
afterwards improved by the late Professor Rankine, and one by Mr J. Macfarlane
Gray, of the Board of Trade, described by that gentleman in 1875, but
since considerably improved. Most of them were laid before the Institution
of Naval Architects in papers which will be found enumerated in the list at end
of chapter. While such propositions did not contribute directly to bring the
problem of stability to its presently accepted form, they deserve to be remembered
as tokens of the great labour and skill which have been expended in
founding and developing this branch of scientific naval architecture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> An obvious means of dealing approximately with stability, to which limits
of space will not permit more than simple reference, consists in so manipulating
the data obtained by calculation for known ships that it may be made available,
either in the form of curves or of tables, for determining the stability of proposed
vessels. Methods of accomplishing this may of course vary to suit the
ideas and convenience of designers. A well-arranged system was brought
forward, jointly by Mr F. P. Purvis, head of Messrs W. Denny &amp; Brothers’
scientific staff, and Mr B. Kindermann, one of his assistants, in a paper (see
list at end of chapter) read before the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders
in April last. While the results exhibited in the paper are immediately applicable
to ships of one particular form, whatever the length, breadth, depth, or
draught may be, this method still requires much development to make it at all
universally applicable.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> It is the usual practice to assume vessels to be laden with homogeneous
cargo of such a density as to fill the holds, and for this condition to estimate the
position of centre of gravity to be used in calculation.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> With the view of effecting an economy in time, and to enable the trials at
progressive speeds to be carried out while vessels are in a lengthened run out
to sea, a method has been proposed by Mr J. H. Biles, naval architect to Messrs
J. &amp; G. Thomson, and adopted on board the vessels tried by that firm, and also
experimented with on some of the vessels turned out by Messrs W. Denny &amp;
Bros., by which the necessity for running with and against the tide on the measured
mile is entirely obviated. The principle of the method is to measure the
time that a certain part of the length of the ship takes to pass an object thrown
from the bows of the vessel well clear of the side. For full particulars, both
of the apparatus employed and of the results of actual trials by this method
compared with trials made on the measured mile, see paper on “Progressive
Speed Trials,” by Mr Biles, in the Transactions: Institution of Naval Architects,
vol. xxiii., 1882.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> A general outline of the operations conducted in Messrs Denny’s tank will
be found in the description of their large works in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chap. VI</a>. For a detailed
account of the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> in the same establishment, see abstract of a
paper delivered in Dumbarton by Mr E. R. Mumford, of Messrs Denny’s
Experimental Staff, printed in the <cite>Engineer</cite> for 15th February and the <cite>Steamship</cite>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> From experimental data obtained by Mr Froude, this correction can be
made with certainty. The reasons for it may be explained as follows:—If an
extremely thin short plane is drawn through the water it meets a certain resistance
due entirely to surface-friction; that is, supposing the plane to be thin enough
to eliminate wave-making and eddy-making. If the length of the plane is doubled
while the depth is kept the same, the resistance at the same speed is not, as might
at first appear to be the case, doubled accordingly. Owing to the friction of (say)
the first half of the plane, the water is made to partake of the motion of the plane,
so that the second half of the length, rubbing not against stationary water, but
against water partially moving in its own direction, does not experience so
much resistance from it. Adding a third equal length, it would have less
surface friction than the second, and so on to infinity.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Following the methods laid down in the Treatise on Shipbuilding, edited
by Prof. Rankine, Mr John Inglis, Pointhouse, instituted calculations in 1873 of
the longitudinal strains of two steamers built by his firm, the form of the waves
being assumed trochoidal. The result of these calculations—which, under Mr
Inglis’ directions, were got out by Mr G. L. Watson, subsequently distinguished
as a yacht designer, and then in the employ of Messrs Inglis—appeared in
the form of curves of hogging moments in <cite>Engineering</cite> for 1st May, 1874. Mr
Inglis found that entering upon the work of calculation had a very decided
effect in giving him clearer ideas of how distribution of weight and buoyancy
affected the structure of a vessel.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The substance of this paper is contained in a series of three articles on the
Strength and Strains of Ships given in “Naval Science” (vol. i. and ii., 1872-3),
a high-class journal ably edited by Sir E. J. Reed, but unfortunately abandoned
after the fourth year of publication.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> It should be stated that under certain circumstances of lading and support
the value assigned by Mr John for the maximum bending moment may be
exceeded in merchant vessels, and that in some special classes of ships—particularly
light-draught vessels in certain circumstances of lading and support—the
sagging moment may prove of most consequence. Instances are indeed on
record of light-draught vessels giving way completely under the excessive sagging
strain brought upon them at sea.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland was formed in
1865 through the amalgamation of two separate bodies—“The Institution of
Engineers in Scotland” and “The Scottish Shipbuilders’ Association.” The
former of these was founded in 1857 and the latter in 1860, the same year in
which “The Institution of Naval Architects” was established. The membership
of the Institution at the present time numbers nearly seven hundred, and
comprises honorary members, members, associates, and graduates: the latter
being a special section of the Institution, designed to embrace students or apprentices
in the profession, and fulfilling a very useful end. The various offices have
long been filled by gentlemen more or less actively engaged in the practice of
shipbuilding or of engineering on the Clyde, and the proceedings have assumed,
on this account alone, a richer practical interest. Scientific subjects have also
received their share of attention, and of the members taking the lead in this
connection the names of Mr J. G. Lawrie and Mr Robert Mansel are worthy
of special mention. Along with Mr Robert Duncan and Mr Lawrance Hill,
these gentlemen have, from the foundation of the Institution, taken a specially
warm interest in its prosperity, and have contributed not a little thereto by
the numerous valuable papers they have brought before its meetings. The
secretary of the Institution is Mr W. J. Millar, C.E., himself the author of
numerous papers, and the editor of the Transactions.</p>
